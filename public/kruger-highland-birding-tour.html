     <!-- Day 1 -->
<section class="bg-slate-100 p-6 rounded-lg shadow border border-black">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Day 1: Arrival in Nelspruit – Transfer to Mount Sheba (Afromontane Forest)</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">Upon morning/early-afternoon arrival in Nelspruit, meet your specialist birding guide and depart in a comfortable, air-conditioned vehicle towards the highlands. The road winds upward through pine forests and picturesque farmland toward the historic town of Pilgrim’s Rest, then onto Mount Sheba, perched on the edge of the Drakensberg Escarpment​. We arrive by mid-afternoon, allowing time to settle in amid the lush surroundings (altitude ~1,400 m) and begin birding the hotel grounds and nearby forest trails.</p>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Afternoon Birding:</strong> The indigenous Afromontane forest at Mount Sheba is one of Mpumalanga’s premier forest birding localities​. We’ll take a leisurely walk on forest trails, listening for the calls of <em>Chorister Robin-Chat</em> (endemic), <em>White-starred Robin</em>, and the haunting “kok-kok-kok” of the <em>Narina Trogon</em> echoing through the mossy trees​. Bird activity peaks in late afternoon as temperatures cool: look for mixed feeding flocks moving through the canopy – species like <em>Cape Batis</em>, <em>Yellow-throated Woodland-Warbler</em>, and <em>Blue-mantled Crested Flycatcher</em> are often present. The understorey may reveal the secretive <em>Orange Ground-Thrush</em>, a local specialty often hopping quietly among leaf litter​. As dusk approaches, keep an ear out for night birds such as the <em>African Wood Owl</em> or <em>Fiery-necked Nightjar</em>.</p>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">Enjoy a hearty dinner at the lodge’s restaurant and a relaxed evening. The forest at night comes alive with sounds – distant baboon barks, insect chirps, and perhaps the odd call of a Tree Hyrax.</p><br>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg"><strong>Accommodation:</strong> Mount Sheba Rainforest Hotel (2 nights). The lodge is set within a private reserve, featuring cozy rooms and forest views. Check-in is typically from 14:00, but early arrival can be arranged; check-out on Day 3 is by 10:00.</p>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mt-4"><strong>Drive:</strong> ~2 hours from Nelspruit to Mount Sheba.<br>
    <strong>Habitat:</strong> Escarpment foothills; mistbelt forest.<br>
    <strong>Accommodation:</strong> Mount Sheba Rainforest Hotel (check-in ~14:00).</p>
</section>

    <!-- Day 2 -->
<section class="bg-slate-100 p-6 rounded-lg shadow border border-black mt-8">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Day 2: Mount Sheba – Afromontane Forest Birding & Panorama Route Option</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Habitats:</strong> Montane forest and grasslands; escarpment cliffs (Panorama Route).<br>
  <strong>Key Birding:</strong> Forest endemics & specials in the morning; optional highveld grassland and cliff raptors mid-day.<br>
  <strong>Activities:</strong> Full day at Mount Sheba area or include Panorama Route excursion.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">A male <em>Narina Trogon</em> – one of the most sought-after birds in Mount Sheba’s mistbelt forest – perches quietly on a lichen-covered branch. This species’ resonant calls and vivid emerald-and-crimson plumage are a highlight of the Afromontane birding experience​.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">We start with coffee and rusks at dawn (a South African tradition) to be in the forest at first light (~05:30). Early morning is prime for bird activity in the cool, often misty forest​. Walking slowly under towering mossy trees, we’ll seek mixed flocks and calling birds. Likely sightings include the <em>Knysna Turaco</em> gliding between treetops, <em>Bar-throated Apalis</em> and <em>Grey Cuckooshrike</em> among canopy flocks, and the soft whistles of <em>Orange Ground-Thrush</em> from the forest floor. We’ll also keep watch for <em>Crowned Eagle</em> circling above. Mount Sheba’s trails vary from gentle paths to moderate inclines; terrain can be damp and uneven, so sturdy walking shoes are recommended.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">Mid-day: After a late breakfast, you have a choice: continue birding the forest and nearby grasslands or embark on the Panorama Route scenic excursion. If you stay, we’ll explore montane grassland where <em>Wing-snapping Cisticola</em>, <em>Wailing Cisticola</em>, and <em>Southern Bald Ibis</em> may be seen. In summer, wildflowers and butterflies abound, and there’s a small chance of encountering the endangered <em>Blue Swallow</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Panorama Route Excursion (Optional):</strong> Depart late morning for a full-day outing to sites like God’s Window, Bourke’s Luck Potholes, and Blyde River Canyon. Birding highlights may include <em>Cape Batis</em>, <em>Knysna Turaco</em>, <em>Swift</em> and <em>Swallow</em> species, <em>Cape Vulture</em>, <em>Peregrine Falcon</em>, <em>Jackal Buzzard</em>, and potentially <em>Taita Falcon</em>. At Three Rondavels, scan for <em>Drakensberg Prinia</em>, <em>Buff-streaked Chat</em>, <em>Cape Rock Thrush</em>, <em>Fan-tailed Grassbird</em>, <em>Mocking Cliff-Chat</em>, and <em>White-necked Raven</em>. Enjoy a picnic or café stop with canyon views.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">Afternoon: Return to Mount Sheba by ~16:00. Relax at the lodge or go for a final forest walk. Dusk brings chances to hear <em>Buff-spotted Flufftail</em>, and see <em>Woodlands Dormouse</em> or <em>Thick-tailed Bushbaby</em> near the gardens. Dinner concludes a rich day of birding, likely with 100+ species on the growing trip list.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mt-4"><strong>Note:</strong> We recommend doing the Panorama Route on transfer day (Day 3) if maximizing forest birding is the goal. Your guide will help tailor the schedule based on preferences and weather.</p>

    <!-- Day 3 -->
<section class="bg-slate-100 p-6 rounded-lg shadow border border-black mt-8">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Day 3: Mount Sheba to Southern Kruger (Transfer via Escarpment to Savanna)</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Drive:</strong> ~3.5–4.5 hours (with stops) from Mount Sheba to Kruger (enter at Orpen or Phabeni Gate).<br>
  <strong>Habitat:</strong> Transition from high escarpment to lowveld savanna.<br>
  <strong>Accommodation:</strong> Kruger National Park Rest Camp (e.g. Satara or Skukuza, 1st of 3 nights in Kruger).</p>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">We depart Mount Sheba after breakfast (around 08:00). If the group opted not to do the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panorama_Route" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline decoration-lime-600 hover:decoration-2 underline-offset-2">
    Panorama Route
  </a> yesterday, we will incorporate some of it today. This makes for a longer travel day but is very rewarding. We’ll check out of the lodge by mid-morning and descend the escarpment, possibly stopping at remaining Panorama Route sights (time permitting) such as Berlin/Lisbon Falls or a quick stroll through the montane grassland at Long Tom Pass if there are target species still sought. By late morning, we leave the highlands behind, winding down into the subtropical lowveld plains. You’ll notice a dramatic change in climate and habitat: the air becomes warmer and drier, and acacia and marula trees replace the ferns and forests. En route, we pass through the town of Hazyview (or Hoedspruit if taking the Orpen Gate route) where we can have lunch and a short break. Keep your binoculars handy – even gas station stops can produce birds like <em>Burchell’s Starling</em> or <em>Little Swift</em> overhead.</p>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Entering Kruger National Park:</strong> Aim to reach a Kruger entrance gate by early-to-mid afternoon. (Exact timing depends on our route; for example, via Orpen Gate around 13:30, or via Phabeni Gate by 14:00). After formalities at the gate (entry fees are covered in your tour), we begin our Kruger adventure! The Kruger National Park, nearly 20,000 km² of protected wilderness, is one of Africa’s greatest wildlife reserves – home to 500+ bird species and the Big Five mammals​. Over the next three days we’ll explore southern Kruger, focusing on its rich birdlife amidst spectacular game viewing.</p>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">This afternoon’s drive will be a leisurely game-drive transfer to our rest camp. We’ll switch to safari mode: windows open (or pop-top roof if available) to take in the smells and sounds of the bush. From the gate to camp can be 1–2 hours’ drive, but we’ll likely take longer as we stop for sightings. In the heat of mid-afternoon, large mammals might be resting, but birds are still active. Almost immediately you’ll notice prolific birdlife: flocks of <em>Red-billed Queleas</em> swirling over grasslands, dazzling <em>Lilac-breasted Rollers</em> perched on thorn branches, and <em>European Bee-eaters</em> hawking insects. Watch for <em>Southern Yellow-billed Hornbills</em> and <em>Burchell’s Glossy-Starlings</em>, plus raptors like <em>Brown Snake-Eagle</em> and <em>Bateleur</em>. Waterholes could hold <em>Egyptian Geese</em>, <em>Three-banded Plovers</em>, or even a <em>Saddle-billed Stork</em>.</p>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">By sunset (~18:00–18:30), we must be inside our rest camp – such as Satara or Skukuza – depending on our game-drive plans. Check-in at Kruger camps is from ~14:00 (we’ll already be in the park). Settle into your air-conditioned chalet or safari tent, which includes en-suite bathroom and basic amenities. Kruger accommodation is comfortable but simple – the focus is the wild surroundings. In the evening, enjoy dinner at the camp restaurant or a catered braai under the stars. Camps are fenced but wildlife like <em>bushbuck</em>, <em>vervet monkeys</em>, or <em>genets</em> may visit. After dinner, take a short walk with flashlights to look for <em>Southern Lesser Galago</em> or listen for owls. Drift to sleep to the calls of <em>hyenas</em> or distant <em>lions</em>.</p>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mt-4"><strong>Notable Birds (Afternoon / Camp):</strong> <em>Southern Ground Hornbill</em>, <em>Crested Francolin</em>, <em>Martial Eagle</em>, <em>Tawny Eagle</em>, <em>Diderick Cuckoo</em>, <em>Woodland Kingfisher</em>, <em>White-faced Scops-Owl</em>, <em>Water Thick-knee</em>, and <em>fruit bats</em> or <em>Bibron’s Gecko</em> around lights. If staying at Skukuza, the Sabie River deck offers scenic evening viewing.</p>

   <!-- Day 4 -->
<section class="bg-slate-100 p-6 rounded-lg shadow border border-black mt-8">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Day 4: Southern Kruger – Big Game and Big Birds (Satara to Skukuza)</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Route:</strong> Morning in Satara area; afternoon drive south to another camp (e.g. Skukuza).<br>
  <strong>Habitat:</strong> Open savanna and acacia woodlands; riverine corridors.<br>
  <strong>Birding Focus:</strong> Savanna specialists – bustards, korhaans, raptors – and mixed bushveld birds.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">We start at first light (camp gates typically open around 04:30–05:30 in these months​). Early morning is prime time for both birding and mammal activity before the heat builds. After a quick coffee, we depart on a pre-breakfast game drive. If we overnighted at Satara, a famous option is the S100 loop, known as one of Kruger’s legendary game drive routes. This road traverses open marula/knobthorn savanna – ideal habitat for <em>Kori Bustard</em> and <em>Northern Black Korhaan</em>. We’ll keep eyes peeled for these plus the elegant <em>Secretarybird</em> striding through the grass. <em>Red-crested Korhaans</em> are common here too, often only detected when they burst into their comical “dive-bombing” display flight. Raptors are abundant: we could spot <em>Martial Eagle</em>, <em>Bateleur</em>, or <em>Gabar Goshawk</em>. Savannah songbirds include <em>Sabota Lark</em>, <em>Blue Waxbill</em>, and <em>Red-billed Firefinch</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">We pause at a picnic site or waterhole for a packed breakfast. While we enjoy coffee and cereal, we’ll watch for birds and other wildlife. After breakfast, we continue our drive south, passing through mixed woodland and thorn thickets. This variety yields <em>Grey-headed Bushshrike</em>, <em>Black-crowned Tchagra</em>, and <em>White-crested Helmetshrikes</em>. Look out for vultures circling overhead – <em>White-backed</em>, <em>Hooded</em>, and the imposing <em>Lappet-faced Vulture</em> may all be seen, especially near carcasses that attract dramatic feeding frenzies involving <em>Marabou Storks</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">By midday or early afternoon, we reach Skukuza Rest Camp, the park’s largest. After check-in (~14:00), we’ll take a break during the heat of the day. Skukuza lies on the Sabie River and is a great birding spot in its own right. After lunch or a siesta, we’ll enjoy a bird walk around camp. Riverine trees here host <em>Purple-crested Turaco</em>, <em>Brown-headed Parrot</em>, and <em>African Green Pigeon</em>. In the camp gardens, look for <em>Bearded Scrub-Robin</em>, <em>Scarlet-chested Sunbird</em>, and <em>Wahlberg’s Epauletted Fruit Bats</em> roosting under thatch. <em>Thick-tailed Bushbaby</em> is a known dusk visitor, and the <em>Square-tailed Nightjar</em> is often heard after dark.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">Before sunset, we’ll take a short game drive near Skukuza. A recommended stop is the Lake Panic Bird Hide, set on a tranquil dam. Here, we may see <em>Malachite</em> and <em>Pied Kingfishers</em>, <em>Black Crake</em>, <em>African Jacana</em>, and possibly <em>Goliath Heron</em> or <em>Greater Painted-snipe</em>. This is also a good area for photography, with late-afternoon light and active birdlife. Occasionally, even <em>Leopard</em> is spotted nearby.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">We return to camp by gate closing and enjoy dinner – possibly a traditional braai under the stars. As night falls, we’ll listen for <em>Fiery-necked Nightjar</em> or a distant <em>leopard</em> call. Expect the species list to pass 200+ today, with a blend of forest and savanna birds. Plans for tomorrow’s full Kruger day will be discussed this evening.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mt-4"><strong>Notable Birds Today:</strong> <em>Southern Ground Hornbill</em>, <em>Ostrich</em> (near Satara), <em>Black-bellied Bustard</em>, <em>Golden-breasted Bunting</em>, <em>Yellow-throated Petronia</em>, <em>European Roller</em>, <em>Lilac-breasted Roller</em>, and rare chances at <em>Thick-billed Cuckoo</em>. Resident raptors and summer visitors like <em>Woodland Kingfisher</em> and <em>Red-backed Shrike</em> round out the day’s diversity. Large mammals including <em>elephants</em>, <em>giraffes</em>, and possibly <em>rhino</em> or <em>lion</em> add to the excitement.</p>

   <!-- Day 5 -->
<section class="bg-slate-100 p-6 rounded-lg shadow border border-black mt-8">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Day 5: Southern Kruger – Exploring Riverine and Bushveld Habitats (Skukuza Region)</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Route:</strong> Skukuza area loops (e.g. Sabie River Road, Pretoriuskop excursion, or Lower Sabie round-trip).<br>
  <strong>Habitat:</strong> Riverine forest, mixed sourveld bushland, and seasonal pans.<br>
  <strong>Birding Focus:</strong> Maximum diversity – waterbirds, woodland birds, migrant songbirds.<br>
  <strong>Activities:</strong> Morning and afternoon game drives; optional mid-day break or guided walk.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">Our second full day in Kruger allows flexibility to target any missing specialties and to enjoy the southern region’s variety. After another early start out of camp, we might begin with a short walking trail inside Skukuza camp before the gates open. The camp’s old trees host seven species of flycatchers (from tiny <em>Grey Tit-Flycatcher</em> to the graceful <em>African Paradise-Flycatcher</em>) and when flowering, the Sycamore Fig trees attract <em>Purple-crested Turaco</em>, <em>African Green Pigeon</em>, and <em>Brown-headed Parrot</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">For the morning drive, one option is to head eastward along the Sabie River toward Lower Sabie. The Sabie River Road (H4-1) is famous for both birds and big game. We’ll stop at viewpoints along the river to scan for <em>Goliath Heron</em>, <em>Saddle-billed Stork</em>, and <em>Nile Crocodile</em>. Riverine forests here hold <em>Black-collared Barbet</em>, <em>Terrestrial Brownbul</em>, and <em>Trumpeter Hornbill</em>, while reedbeds may yield <em>Red-faced Cisticola</em> and <em>White-fronted Bee-eater</em> colonies. <em>African Fish Eagles</em> call overhead, and we’ll scan for early morning raptors like <em>Martial</em> or <em>African Hawk-Eagle</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">We reach Lower Sabie by late morning to enjoy brunch on the camp deck overlooking the dam. It’s a great place to spot <em>Giant Kingfisher</em>, <em>Hamerkop</em>, and various swallows and swifts. After a rest, we may return via Doispane Road or head west toward Pretoriuskop if certain species are still being sought. Pretoriuskop’s higher elevation and sourveld grassland support birds like <em>Dark Chanting Goshawk</em>, <em>Lazy Cisticola</em>, <em>Crowned Hornbill</em>, and possibly even <em>Sable Antelope</em>. A stop at Shabeni Granite Koppie may provide <em>Lizard Buzzard</em>, <em>Brown-crowned Tchagra</em>, and <em>Gorgeous Bushshrike</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">During the midday heat (13:00–15:00), we’ll rest at Skukuza – with options to nap, swim, or bird around camp. Optional activities include a SANParks-guided walk or a visit to the camp’s museum and nursery, where <em>sunbirds</em> are often active.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">For our final Kruger afternoon, we might explore the Mlaleni/Doispane Road (S1) toward Phabeni Gate. This productive stretch yields <em>Carmine Bee-eaters</em>, <em>Yellow-billed Kites</em>, and mixed seedeater flocks including <em>Green-winged Pytilia</em>, <em>Blue Waxbill</em>, and <em>Jameson’s Firefinch</em>. We’ll check waterholes for <em>African Jacana</em> and <em>Egyptian Goose</em>, and scan known spots for <em>Southern Ground Hornbill</em>. Toward dusk, we may find <em>Verreaux’s Eagle-Owl</em> or <em>Chestnut-backed Sparrow-Lark</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">Our last night in Kruger includes a celebratory dinner and the option of a SANParks night drive (typically 20:00–22:00). These drives offer chances for <em>civets</em>, <em>genets</em>, <em>porcupines</em>, and <em>African wild cat</em>, plus night birds such as <em>Square-tailed Nightjar</em>, <em>Pennant-winged Nightjar</em> (summer), and owls like <em>Verreaux’s Eagle-Owl</em> and <em>African Scops-Owl</em>. Those staying at camp may enjoy stargazing under pristine skies. Our bird list by now could exceed 250 species, reflecting the region’s extraordinary biodiversity.</p>
</section>

   
<!-- Day 6 -->
<section class="bg-slate-100 p-6 rounded-lg shadow border border-black mt-8">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Day 6: Kruger to Sabi Sand Private Reserve (Umkumbe Lodge)</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Drive:</strong> ~2 hours from Skukuza to Umkumbe Safari Lodge (exit Kruger at Paul Kruger Gate).<br>
  <strong>Habitat:</strong> Lowveld riverine bushveld in a private reserve (Sabie Game Reserve, part of Sabi Sands).<br>
  <strong>Accommodation:</strong> Umkumbe Safari Lodge, Sabie Game Reserve (Night 1 of 3).</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">This morning offers one last Kruger game drive. We’ll depart Skukuza at gate opening time for a farewell drive west toward Paul Kruger Gate. Perhaps we’ll follow the Sabie River once more to check off any missed species – maybe even try for the elusive <em>Pel’s Fishing Owl</em> if reports are promising. More likely, we’ll soak in final sightings: <em>elephants</em> at sunrise or a troop of <em>Chacma baboons</em> warming in the early sun. Around 08:00–09:00, we exit Kruger at Paul Kruger Gate, concluding our time in the national park.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">After exiting, it’s a short drive on the R536 toward Hazyview, then onto gravel into the Sabi reserve. We arrive at Umkumbe Safari Lodge around 11:00. Overlooking the Sand River in the southern Sabi Sands, the lodge offers fantastic wildlife viewing right from the deck. After check-in and lunch (~13:00), enjoy time to relax – look for <em>impala</em>, <em>waterbuck</em>, or <em>elephants</em> at the river. Around the lodge, common birds include <em>Arrow-marked Babbler</em>, <em>Grey Go-away-bird</em>, and <em>Pied Kingfisher</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Afternoon Game Drive (Sabi Sands):</strong> At 15:30, we meet our ranger and tracker for a private game drive. Open 4x4 vehicles and off-road access make this reserve a top safari experience. While mammals – especially <em>leopard</em> – are a highlight, our team understands our birding interest. We’ll drive through riverine thickets, clay pans, and knobthorn veld. Look for <em>Southern White-crowned Shrike</em>, <em>Purple Roller</em>, <em>Marico Sunbird</em>, and perhaps <em>Pearl-spotted Owlet</em>. At sunset, we stop for sundowners, then continue with a spotlight to search for nocturnal life: <em>Fiery-necked Nightjar</em>, <em>African Civet</em>, <em>Large-spotted Genet</em>, <em>Scops Owl</em>, and more.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">Return to Umkumbe by ~19:00 for a delicious outdoor dinner (weather permitting). Dining is often beside a fire under the stars. Enjoy calls of <em>hyenas</em>, sightings of <em>Thick-tailed Bushbaby</em>, and stories of the bush. The lodge offers comfortable chalets; fall asleep to the sounds of the Sabie River – perhaps a <em>Scops Owl</em> trill or distant lions.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mt-4"><strong>Bird & Wildlife Notes:</strong> Sabi Sands has high predator densities, especially <em>leopards</em>. Birds largely overlap with Kruger but include nuances like <em>Bushveld Pipit</em>, <em>Burnt-necked Eremomela</em>, and <em>Orange-breasted Bushshrike</em>. Off-road access improves photo opportunities – from <em>Ground Hornbills</em> to <em>Lilac-breasted Rollers</em>. Waterbirds include <em>Hadeda Ibis</em>, <em>Black-winged Stilt</em>, and with luck, <em>African Finfoot</em>. At night, expect insect and frog choruses – the immersive soundtrack of summer bushveld.</p>

    <!-- Day 7 -->
<section class="bg-slate-100 p-6 rounded-lg shadow border border-black mt-8">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Day 7: Sabi Sands (Umkumbe Lodge) – Private Reserve Birding & Big Game</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Schedule:</strong> Morning and Evening Game Drives, with mid-day break. Optional bush walk.<br>
  <strong>Habitat:</strong> Lowveld combretum woodland, riverine forest, and open clearings.<br>
  <strong>Birding Highlights:</strong> Savanna residents + summer migrants; night birds and raptors.<br>
  <strong>Wildlife:</strong> Intimate encounters with game (Big Five and more). Photographic opportunities abound.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">At Umkumbe, the day begins with a 05:00 wake-up and tea or coffee, followed by a 05:30 departure for the morning game drive. The open vehicles and off-road tracking make every drive an adventure. If fresh <em>lion</em> or <em>wild dog</em> tracks are found, the ranger may pursue them – and while mammals are a focus, birds are always on our radar. Early morning sightings may include <em>Brown Snake-Eagle</em>, <em>Martial Eagle</em>, and <em>Bateleur</em>, with calls of <em>Grey-headed</em> and <em>Orange-breasted Bushshrikes</em> from the thickets. Crested Guineafowl, Southern Ground Hornbill, <em>Carmine Bee-eater</em>, and <em>Grey-headed Kingfisher</em> are possible highlights. With luck, we may even spot a roosting <em>Pennant-winged Nightjar</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">We stop mid-morning for coffee and snacks in the bush. Keep an ear out for <em>Cuckoo Hawk</em> or chattering <em>Puffbacks</em>. Afterward, we return to the lodge by ~09:30–10:00 for breakfast.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Mid-day Leisure:</strong> The lodge offers a pool and shaded river deck for relaxing. Birding continues with <em>Marico Sunbird</em>, <em>Brubru</em>, <em>Chinspot Batis</em>, or <em>Green-backed Camaroptera</em>. Optional guided bush walks reveal tracks, nesting weavers, or the call of <em>Black Cuckooshrike</em>. Walks are easy-paced and about 1–1.5 hours long.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">After lunch and siesta, we reconvene at 15:30 for the afternoon drive. This session may explore lush riparian forest in the south. Look and listen for <em>African Green Pigeon</em>, <em>White-crowned Lapwing</em>, and the iconic <em>Woodland Kingfisher</em>. With sharp eyes and local knowledge, we might locate <em>Bearded Woodpecker</em>, <em>African Barred Owlet</em>, or <em>Verreaux’s Eagle-Owl</em>. At dusk, <em>Fork-tailed Drongos</em> or <em>Helmeted Guineafowl</em> alarm calls may help us locate a prowling <em>leopard</em>. Nocturnal targets include <em>Spotted Eagle-Owl</em>, <em>Fiery-necked Nightjar</em>, and – if lucky – <em>Bronze-winged Courser</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">Return to the lodge by ~19:00 for dinner under the stars. It’s our final safari night – a time to celebrate the journey and reflect on highlights, from the forests of Mount Sheba to the Kruger savannas and the intimate Sabi bushveld. We’ll review our checklist, now likely bursting past 250 species. Tonight, perhaps a <em>Scops Owl</em> or distant <em>lion</em> call will serenade us into restful sleep.</p>
</section>

    <!-- Day 8 -->
<section class="bg-slate-100 p-6 rounded-lg shadow border border-black mt-8">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Day 8: Sabi Sands (Umkumbe Lodge) – Final Safari Day</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Schedule:</strong> Last full day of morning & afternoon drives in Sabi Sands.<br>
  <strong>Focus:</strong> Target any remaining species or mammals; enjoy photography and the overall experience.<br>
  <strong>Pace:</strong> Relaxed, with flexibility – this day can be tailored (e.g. longer drive or time in a hide).</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">On our final full day, we have the freedom to shape the schedule to our interests. If our bird list is missing a few tricky species, we can dedicate time to find them – perhaps <em>Southern Yellow-billed Hornbill</em>, <em>Senegal Lapwing</em>, or <em>Temminck’s Courser</em> on open grassland. Alternatively, we might focus on photography – revisiting a waterhole or staking out a flowering tree for sunbirds.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Morning Drive:</strong> We may visit a neighboring property for new terrain – open savanna or marshy zones to search for species like <em>Coqui Francolin</em>, <em>African Crake</em>, or <em>Black Coucal</em> (in wet years). Summer may bring nomads like <em>Locustfinch</em> or <em>Quailfinch</em>. The guide and tracker will follow up on any rare sightings. We may extend this drive and enjoy a special bush brunch, dining al fresco with bird calls all around.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Midday:</strong> Back at camp, time to relax, pack, or visit the lodge hide if available. The waterhole may draw <em>Blue Waxbill</em>, <em>Green Pigeon</em>, <em>Amethyst Sunbird</em>, or <em>Yellow-throated Petronia</em>. Nyala or Warthogs often appear here too.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Afternoon Drive:</strong> One last game drive to enjoy every moment. We might track <em>African Wild Dogs</em>, or spend golden hour near a waterhole. Expect birds like <em>Yellow-billed Stork</em>, <em>African Spoonbill</em>, <em>Grey Heron</em>, <em>Jacanas</em>, and perhaps <em>Hippos</em> becoming active. Our final sundowner marks the trip’s close, followed by spotlighting for <em>Wild Cat</em>, <em>Bushbaby</em>, or <em>Pennant-winged Nightjar</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">After returning to camp, a festive farewell dinner is served. Staff may sing or dance in celebration. We’ll share highlights, complete the checklist, and reflect on the birds and memories made. Sleep one final night to the soundtrack of the wild – a <em>Scops Owl</em> trill or the echo of <em>hyenas</em> calling through the dark.</p>
</section>

<!-- Day 9 -->
<section class="bg-slate-100 p-6 rounded-lg shadow border border-black mt-8">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Day 9: Sabi Sands to Nelspruit – Departure</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Drive:</strong> ~2.5 hours to Nelspruit (Mbombela), depending on drop-off location and stops.<br>
  <strong>Morning:</strong> Final game drive or bush walk (time permitting), then depart lodge by late morning.<br>
  <strong>Tour Ends:</strong> Early afternoon in Nelspruit (or at KMIA airport, depending on your plans).</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">On our last morning, we have the option of a short game drive at dawn or a relaxed breakfast at camp, depending on your departure timing. If time allows, we’ll definitely do one more early outing – perhaps catching a final glimpse of a <em>Cheetah</em> or <em>Denham’s Bustard</em>. Those staying behind may enjoy sunrise from the deck with coffee, surrounded by the morning chorus: <em>Orange-breasted Bushshrikes</em> duetting, <em>Laughing Doves</em> cooing, and maybe the distant call of <em>hyenas</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">We say farewell to the Umkumbe team and check out around 10:30. The drive to Nelspruit takes us through scenic lowveld farmland and rural villages. We might make one or two birding stops en route – even roadside sightings can include <em>Wire-tailed Swallow</em> or <em>Lesser Kestrel</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">By early afternoon, we reach Nelspruit or KMIA airport, where the tour concludes. Your guide will assist with airport drop-off or transfers. It’s the end of an incredible journey: from Afromontane forests with <em>Chorister Robin-Chats</em> to bushveld sunsets with <em>Fiery-necked Nightjars</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">We provide a comprehensive trip report including your full bird and mammal checklist. Don’t hesitate to reach out post-trip for photo IDs or to share your highlights. This itinerary offers a stunning snapshot of South Africa’s birdlife and biodiversity – we hope it’s sparked lasting memories and perhaps the start of more birding safaris to come!</p>

<!-- Habitats & Seasonal Highlights -->
<section class="bg-white max-w-[1020px] mx-auto p-6 mt-12">
  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Habitats &amp; Seasonal Highlights</h2>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Afromontane Forest (Mount Sheba)</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">Lush, misty forests atop the escarpment, with tall stinkwood, yellowwood, and fig trees draped in moss. This habitat yielded forest gems like <em>Narina Trogon</em>, <em>Knysna Turaco</em>, and endemic <em>Chorister Robin-Chats</em>. The cool, wet climate means these forests are often cloaked in fog, especially in early mornings. September to April brings peak bird activity: September/October sees <em>Chorister Robin-Chats</em> and <em>Bar-throated Apalis</em> nesting, while November–December welcomes migrants like <em>Emerald Cuckoo</em>. By late summer, fledglings abound, and fruiting trees attract flocks of <em>Green Pigeons</em> and <em>Turacos</em>. Highland grasslands on the Panorama Route yielded cisticola displays and possible <em>Blue Swallow</em> sightings (Nov–Feb), while cliffs hosted <em>Cape Vulture</em> and breeding <em>Taita Falcon</em> (Aug–Nov).</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Lowveld Savanna (Kruger &amp; Sabi Sands)</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">Characterized by acacia and combretum woodlands, open plains, and seasonal rivers, the lowveld forms the core of this tour. Spring (Sept–Oct) offers clear views and early migrant arrivals, while summer (Dec–Jan) is lush and full of life. <em>Wahlberg’s Eagles</em>, <em>Woodland Kingfishers</em>, <em>European Rollers</em>, and many other migrants filled the skies. December brought weaver colonies, raptor fledglings, and fruiting trees alive with sunbirds. By Feb–March, the bird diversity remained high, though some migrants began preparing for departure. Thunderstorms added drama to the afternoons, while early morning and late-day drives ensured the best sightings in pleasant temperatures (~20°C mornings, 30–32°C afternoons).</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Special Birds &amp; Endemics</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">This tour blended forest endemics with savanna specials. Highlights included <em>Knysna Turaco</em>, <em>Chorister Robin-Chat</em>, <em>Orange Ground-Thrush</em>, <em>Drakensberg Prinia</em>, <em>Buff-streaked Chat</em>, and savanna near-endemics like <em>Southern Ground Hornbill</em>, <em>Southern White-crowned Shrike</em>, <em>Brown-headed Parrot</em>, and <em>Burchell’s Coucal</em>. Summer sightings included <em>Amur Falcon</em>, <em>European Honey-Buzzard</em>, and <em>Broad-billed Roller</em>. Raptors such as <em>Lappet-faced Vulture</em> and <em>Martial Eagle</em> added grandeur, while <em>Square-tailed Nightjar</em> and <em>Spotted Eagle-Owl</em> enriched night drives.</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Photography</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">Diverse habitats offered rewarding photography – from misty forests and canyon landscapes to close-up safari moments. Highlights included <em>Lake Panic Hide</em> (Malachite Kingfisher, Painted-snipes), action shots of large raptors, and creative lighting on mammals and birds in Sabi Sands. Tips included using beanbags/clamps in vehicles, combining long (300–500mm) and mid-range lenses, and making use of mid-day editing breaks.</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Weather Patterns</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">Spring to summer brought warm to hot days and seasonal storms. Mount Sheba had cool mornings (~12–15°C) and 20–25°C days. Kruger and Sabi averaged 20°C at dawn and 30–32°C mid-afternoon. Storms were brief but refreshing. Insects were present but manageable with repellent. Guests were reminded to stay hydrated and sun-protected on drives.</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Park &amp; Lodge Logistics</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">SANParks gate times (04:30–18:30) structured Kruger days, with early drives and efficient camp returns. Satara and Skukuza offered comfort and convenience. Umkumbe Lodge in Sabi Sands featured open drives, no fences, and night outings for nocturnal birds. Lodge meals, timing, and hospitality were a tour highlight.</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Terrain &amp; Vehicle</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">Terrain varied from tar roads to forest trails and sandy game tracks. A minibus handled transfers; open 4x4s were used in Sabi Sands. Motion sickness prep helped on the Panorama Route. Walking was moderate and manageable, with optional guided walks and trail support. The itinerary’s balance of rest and activity suited all fitness levels.</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Group Size &amp; Private Tour Benefits</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4">This is a private tour, meaning your group has full flexibility in pace, daily focus, and photo stops. We typically cap the group at 6 for optimal comfort and guaranteed window seats. Larger groups (7–8 people) can be accommodated with custom arrangements. Per-person pricing adjusts based on group size.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">This comprehensive package includes everything needed for a worry-free trip – even entry fees along the Panorama Route and daily coffee stops. You can truly relax, knowing your logistics are covered, and focus fully on the birds, wildlife, and scenery.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Pricing and Inclusions</h2>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-6">This 9-day private tour is fully inclusive and priced on a sliding scale depending on group size (minimum 2 guests, maximum 6 for this itinerary). Per-person costs decrease as group size increases, since certain costs (guide, vehicle, etc.) are shared. Below are indicative pricing examples for 2025:</p>

A single supplement would apply if anyone requires their own room. Actual pricing may vary based on exact travel dates (seasonality), any customizations, and currency fluctuations – please contact us for a precise quote. Note: September–April is high season for birding; while lodge rates in Kruger/Sabi are generally consistent year-round, holiday periods in December might add a small premium..</p>
