    The Warm Heart of Africa for Birders
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Malawi likes to describe itself as “The Warm Heart of Africa,” a nickname earned through the genuine friendliness and warmth of its people​. Travelers quickly feel at home here – smiling villagers, vibrant local markets, and a rich cultural heritage make every journey special. This welcoming atmosphere sets the tone for a birding tour that is as much about people and place as it is about birds.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      As one of Africa’s smaller countries, Malawi surprises visitors with its astonishing ecological diversity. Within its borders you’ll find Great Rift Valley lakes, expansive wetlands, miombo woodlands, and misty highlands. This range of habitats is carried to an extreme, resulting in over 650 species of birds recorded in Malawi’s comparatively small area​ – an impressive number that promises birders a new surprise at each turn. In fact, Malawi’s avifauna is quite distinct from the drier regions of southern Africa, with many species here at the edge of their ranges or easier to spot than in neighboring countries. The country has only one true endemic bird (the endangered Yellow-throated Apalis found in southern montane forests​), but it hosts a wealth of regional specialties and migratory visitors. From November to April, migratory birds arrive from Eurasia, adding even more variety to the checklist​.

      Malawi’s landscapes are as enchanting as its birdlife. Picture yourself on the shores of Lake Malawi (the third-largest lake in Africa), listening to the cry of an African Fish Eagle as fishermen launch their wooden canoes at dawn. Or imagine strolling through a sun-dappled forest in the highlands, the air filled with the calls of turacos and babblers.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">

      The country’s topography ranges from the low-lying lake basin to high plateaus like Nyika over 2,000 m (6,600 ft) above sea level, offering sweeping vistas. In the highlands, patches of evergreen forest cling to mountainsides, harboring elusive warblers and trogons, while orchids and wildflowers speckle the grasslands​. Down in the valleys, rivers like the Shire weave through baobab-studded savanna, drawing elephants, antelope, and a chorus of birdlife. Good roads and a safe, friendly environment make travel in Malawi a pleasure​. A typical birding tour here will span the length of the country, uncovering its natural jewels and cultural delights. Below, we’ll journey through some of the must-visit destinations on Malawi birding tours – each stop showcasing a unique facet of Malawi’s birdlife, scenery, and charm.

      Lilongwe
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Malawi’s birding adventures often begin in Lilongwe, the nation’s capital city nestled in the central region. Lilongwe offers a gentle introduction to the country’s landscapes and people. Despite being a capital, it’s a surprisingly green city: patches of acacia woodland, gardens, and the Lilongwe River meandering through give it a relaxed, semi-rural feel. You might wake up on your first morning to the sound of doves cooing and thrushes singing in the hotel garden.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
    In the suburbs, Lilongwe Nature Sanctuary (also called the Wildlife Centre) provides an early taste of Malawi’s wildlife. Here, on a stroll along wooded trails by the river, you can spot colorful birds even within the city. Lilongwe is known to harbor species like the Olive Sunbird and the secretive Red-throated Twinspot in its urban sanctuary – a delightful surprise to find in the middle of a capital city. Vervet monkeys chatter in the trees, and you might catch a glimpse of bushbuck deer or a monitor lizard near the water, reminding you that even the city lives up to Malawi’s wild richness. Lilongwe is also the gateway to Malawi’s culture; birders can explore craft markets or enjoy a meal of local Chambo fish, all while soaking up the friendly Malawian hospitality that makes every visitor feel welcome.

      Kumbali Country Lodge
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Just outside Lilongwe, set on a 650-hectare private reserve and dairy farm, lies Kumbali Country Lodge – a favorite first (or last) stop on many birding itineraries​. This tranquil lodge is a destination in itself, offering a soft landing in Malawi’s bush. The grounds are lush and bird-filled, with well-tended gardens, woodlands, and even a small game reserve on the property. Guests wake to the sound of dawn choruses in the trees and enjoy views of wooded hills from their verandas. The lodge’s farm grows its own produce, and the farm-to-table meals are often raved about by visitors.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      But for birders, the real treat is stepping out into Kumbali’s trails. Bird watching is a fun way to while away time in the sunshine here, in their extensive forest reserve​. You can encounter a huge variety of garden and woodland birds on an easy walk: listen for the liquid calls of turacos and barbets, watch weavers and sunbirds flit among the flowering bushes, or perhaps spot a Spotted Eagle-Owl roosting. In fact, the lodge has a few resident owls that have taken up home in the thatched roofs – “including owls which permanently reside in the dining room ceiling” as the lodge notes!​. It’s a magical experience to dine by lamplight with the soft hoots of an owl overhead. Kumbali’s reserve has also been stocked with some savannah wildlife – you might see a small group of zebra or antelope like sable and impala grazing in the distance on a guided nature walk​. It’s the perfect spot to recover from a long flight and get one’s first taste of Malawi’s warm heart and natural beauty, all in one place.

      Lilongwe Wildlife Centre
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      In the heart of Lilongwe, the Lilongwe Wildlife Centre (also known as the Nature Sanctuary) offers birders an oasis of greenery and conservation. This award-winning wildlife rescue and education center is set in a 180-hectare tract of woodland right in the city. Walking the shaded trails here, you could easily forget you’re minutes from government offices and city shops. The mix of riverine forest and thornbush within the sanctuary creates habitats for many species. Birdwatching is a highlight at the Centre – it’s noted as a must-visit spot for birding in Malawi’s capital​. Patience and quiet observation might reward you with sightings of the Olive Sunbird, a shimmering green-and-grey nectar lover that flits through the foliage. On the forest floor, keep an eye out for the Red-throated Twinspot, a tiny finch with scarlet breast patches known to hop in the undergrowth here​. These are special finds for an urban location. Over 100 bird species have been recorded in the sanctuary, from bee-eaters and kingfishers along the Lingadzi River to woodland kingfishers and cuckoos in the trees.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Beyond birds, the Wildlife Centre is home to various rescued animals – you might see baboons, monkeys, or antelopes that are rehabilitated here, and occasionally larger animals under care (the Centre has rehabilitated servals and even lions in the past). As you wander, you’ll likely encounter troops of vervet monkeys scampering in the canopy and maybe a family of warthogs snuffling in the underbrush. Interpretive signs and viewing hides make it easy to enjoy the wildlife. Visiting the Lilongwe Wildlife Centre not only gives you great birding and photography opportunities, but also a chance to learn about Malawi’s conservation efforts. All proceeds support wildlife rescue, embodying Malawi’s commitment to protecting its natural heritage even amid urban growth. It’s a refreshing stop that balances the excitement of an upcoming wilderness tour with a gentle introduction to Malawi’s flora and fauna.

      Dzalanyama Forest Reserve 
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Leaving Lilongwe, many birding tours head to the Dzalanyama Forest Reserve, a vast expanse of miombo woodland about an hour or two southwest of the city. As you ascend into Dzalanyama’s rolling hills, the habitat changes to miombo – a Brachystegia-dominated dry woodland that is one of Africa’s richest bird habitats. At first glance, miombo forest can seem quiet and endless, but birders know that patience here pays off in golden encounters. Dzalanyama is often cited as Malawi’s top miombo birding site, and indeed it is “of great interest to birders” for its plethora of special species​. Walking through the warm woodland, you might suddenly hear chirps and fluttering – the sign of a mixed feeding flock moving through. Miombo birds often travel in multi-species bands, and once you find such a flock, the sightings come in a rush. Drongos and tits lead the way while woodpeckers, cuckoos, flycatchers, and warblers follow in their wake​, all foraging frantically. It’s a thrilling moment for even seasoned birdwatchers.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      At Dzalanyama, there are several sought-after “miombo specialist” birds with limited ranges. Keen birders hope to spot the Stierling’s Woodpecker, a subtly-marked woodpecker found almost only in miombo woodlands of south-central Africa​. The reserve is one of the best places to find it. Also on the wishlist is the Boulder Chat, a chat (thrush-like bird) that lives around rocky outcrops – Dzalanyama’s granite boulders sometimes have a pair of these curious charcoal-colored birds singing atop them​. As you continue, you might glimpse a flash of red and blue: that could be Anchieta’s Sunbird (also called the Red-and-blue Sunbird), feeding on mistletoe blooms. Flocks of seedeaters and waxbills forage in the grasses; among them the Black-eared Seedeater and Red-capped Crombec are notable finds​. Predatory birds are around too – listen for the ringing calls of Southern Ground Hornbills or the plaintive whistle of a African Cuckoo-Hawk gliding overhead. One coveted bird here is the Sousa’s Shrike, a rare and striking grey-white bushshrike that Malawi birders treasure​. With luck, an expert local guide will know the territories where these birds often skulk.

    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Beyond its birds, Dzalanyama charms visitors with its serene atmosphere. Butterflies dance along the paths, and the scent of wild miombo blossoms fills the air in the rainy season. Small streams flow through the reserve, where you might take a break and find more birds – perhaps a Bushshrike taking a drink or a Kingfisher hunting for frogs. As evening falls, the woodland comes alive with the sounds of nightjars and owls. Staying overnight at a simple forest lodge, one drifts off to the distant hoot of a Wood Owl and the clear night sky studded with stars. Dzalanyama is a true birder’s paradise, offering a deep immersion into Malawi’s woodland avifauna and a peaceful retreat in nature.

      Zomba Plateau
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Heading southward, the landscape of Malawi rises again at the Zomba Plateau – a large table-top mountain in the southern part of the country. The plateau, reaching about 2,085 m (6,840 ft) at its peak, is an entirely different world of cool misty forests, pine plantations, and sweeping vistas. Once the site of Malawi’s colonial capital, Zomba town at the foot of the mountain has historical charm, but for birders the real allure is ascending the plateau’s winding road into the Zomba Forest Reserve. Much of the plateau is covered in plantations now, but pockets of montane evergreen forest and riverine jungle remain, harboring some of Malawi’s most sought-after birds​.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      One such jewel is the White-winged Apalis, a beautiful black-and-yellow warbler with bold white wing patches. This species is near-threatened and found only in a few highland forests of Malawi and Tanzania – Zomba Plateau is one of the places it survives​. Lucky birders might catch a glimpse of a male apalis flitting through the canopy, flashing its wings and singing a high, thin song. Even rarer, the plateau holds the Thyolo Alethe, a shy brown-backed thrush-like bird endemic to Malawi’s southern forests. Sightings of the alethe are elusive (it hides in dense undergrowth), but just knowing such an endangered endemic is nearby adds to the excitement. More commonly, Zomba’s forests offer delights like the Bar-tailed Trogon, a gorgeous red-and-green bird that sits motionless on vines – until it swoops to snatch an insect with extraordinary quickness. Colorful sunbirds such as the Ludwig’s Double-collared Sunbird and Olive-headed Sunbird sip nectar from flowering bushes​. The calls of Trumpeter Hornbills echo through the valleys, and troops of Samango monkeys (blue monkeys) rustle in the treetops, occasionally knocking down a cascade of leaves. This plateau was once rich in wildlife – it’s said that up to 30 years ago, herds of antelope roamed here​ – but today you are more likely to find only smaller creatures: duikers dashing across the path or rock dassies sunning on boulders.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Zomba Plateau’s scenery is simply breathtaking. Birders will want to take in the famous viewpoints like Chingwe’s Hole or Queen’s View, where one can gaze out over the plains stretching to Lake Chilwa and Mozambique in the distance. Waterfalls such as Williams Falls and Mandala Falls tumble off the plateau, their spray nourishing ferns and creating glades where forest birds gather. In the early morning, the plateau is often cloaked in mists, with the aroma of wildflowers and moss. By mid-day, sunshine breaks through, illuminating butterflies and the bright plumage of birds. Montane species like the Orange Ground-Thrush scratch in the leaf litter, and Green-headed Orioles whistle mellow notes from fig trees​. Every moment on Zomba Plateau feels enchanted – it’s a mix of natural wonder and a touch of colonial-era history (with an old mountain inn and remnants of past estates) that gives it a unique character. For birders, it’s an essential stop to seek montane forest specials and to simply revel in a cool highland haven.

      Liwonde National Park
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Liwonde National Park is often the crown jewel of Malawi’s wildlife destinations – a park that offers an exhilarating mix of classic African big game and superb birdwatching. Located in the south along the Shire River, Liwonde is a relatively small park (about 548 km²) but packs in a tremendous density of animals along its waterways and savannas. As you enter the park, you’re greeted by the sight of Borassus palm trees and groves of fever trees lining the river, and perhaps a herd of impala or waterbuck bounding away. Liwonde’s animal populations have rebounded impressively under dedicated conservation management, and today it’s common to see African elephants roaming in large numbers. (Indeed, Liwonde is one of the best places in Malawi to see elephants – they are common and often seen bathing or browsing in the marshes​.) On a drive or boat safari, you might also spot sable antelope, hippos (by the hundreds!), crocodiles, warthogs, and even reintroduced cheetahs or lions lounging in the shade. Birding in Liwonde is extraordinary from the moment you get on the water: taking a boat safari on the Shire River is a highlight of any visit. As you glide along, flocks of African Openbill Storks work the shallows, Pied Kingfishers hover and dive for fish, and the haunting cry of the African Fish Eagle echoes from the trees – you are likely to see these majestic fish eagles perched every few hundred meters, as “fish eagles…are never far away” in this habitat​.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Liwonde is particularly famed for certain “special” birds that are hard to find elsewhere. Birders coming to Liwonde often have a checklist that includes Böhm’s Bee-eater, a lovely orange-throated bee-eater that prefers the park’s dense riverine thickets, Brown-breasted Barbet, a chunky fruit-eating bird with a loud knock-knock call, and Lilian’s Lovebird, a small green and peach parrot which flocks in the mopane woodlands​. All three of these species reach the core of their range in Liwonde, making the park a must-visit. A skilled guide can usually help locate chattering groups of Lilian’s Lovebirds feeding in seeding grasses or point out a Böhm’s Bee-eater sallying after insects from a high branch. Liwonde’s guides are also famously adept at finding the Pel’s Fishing Owl – this giant ginger-colored owl is a coveted sight for birders. At dusk, you might drift along the river and have a guide whisper and point: there, tucked in the canopy, a huge owl with glowing eyes peers back. Local knowledge often leads visitors to a day-roosting Pel’s Fishing Owl, allowing a rare daytime view of this nocturnal hunter​. Another elusive resident is the White-backed Night Heron, sometimes seen along quiet channels at the water’s edge near camps​.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Daytime birding in Liwonde yields an endless parade of sightings. Brilliant Malachite Kingfishers dart like flying gems. Hornbills (including the impressive Ground Hornbill and cheeky Red-billed Hornbill) are common in the woodland glades​. Raptors soar overhead – keep an eye out for the elegant Bateleur with its teetering flight or a Martial Eagle riding thermals​. In palm trees, the small Dickinson’s Kestrel may be perched, and Palm-nut Vultures (unusual vultures that eat palm fruit) also occur in the area​. Along the riverbanks, African Jacanas tip-toe on lily pads and flocks of White-faced Whistling Ducks take to wing when disturbed. A bird list for Liwonde can easily top 300 species, but it’s not just the numbers – it’s the experience of seeing them among such abundant wildlife. One moment you’re watching a Collared Palm-Thrush hop around your lodge veranda (they are “garden birds” at camps like Mvuu​), and the next you’re startled by a splash as a pod of hippos grunts nearby.

    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Evenings in Liwonde are magical. As the sun sets over the river, thousands of waterbirds fly in to roost. You might hear the distant “goodnight” calls of doves and the distinctive “whoop” of hyenas starting their night. Night drives can reveal Square-tailed Nightjars fluttering up from the tracks and African Scops Owls calling from tree stumps​. Meanwhile, the southern sky overhead is brilliant with stars. By conserving its wildlife and welcoming visitors, Liwonde embodies Malawi’s commitment to its natural treasures. It’s an essential stop on any Malawi birding tour – a place where one can tick off dozens of bird species in a day, and also simply enjoy the thrill of classic African safari moments, like watching an elephant herd crossing the river at sunset with egrets perched on their backs.

       Best time to go on a Malawi Birding Tour
      </h2>
      
      <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700">
        ​Malawi offers exceptional birdwatching opportunities throughout the year, with approximately 80% of its 650 bird species being residents. However, the optimal period for a birding tour is from late October to April, aligning with the arrival of migratory species from Europe and North Africa, thereby enhancing the diversity of sightings. During these months, many birds are in their breeding plumage, displaying vibrant colors that are particularly appealing to birdwatchers. It's important to note that while this timeframe offers increased bird activity, it also coincides with Malawi's rainy season, which can make certain areas less accessible due to heavy rains and flooding. For those interested in combining birding with game viewing, the dry season from May to October provides better wildlife visibility, though bird diversity may be slightly reduced. Additionally, some lodges, particularly around Lake Malawi, may close from early January to late March due to high rainfall and humid conditions. Therefore, planning your visit between October to December or April to May can offer a balanced experience of favorable weather and rich birdlife.
