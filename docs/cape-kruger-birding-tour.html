    <!-- Day 1 -->
<section class="bg-zinc-100 p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Day 1: Arrive in Cape Town – Cape Peninsula and Kirstenbosch</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Region &amp; Habitat:</strong> Cape Town &amp; Peninsula (fynbos, wetlands, coastal cliffs)</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Daily Outline:</strong> After a morning/afternoon arrival in Cape Town, meet your guide and begin exploring the Cape Peninsula. Start at the world-renowned <a href="https://www.sanbi.org/gardens/kirstenbosch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline decoration-slate-600 hover:decoration-2 underline-offset-2">Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens</a> on the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, where lush montane fynbos habitat yields endemics like <em>Cape Sugarbird</em> and <em>Orange-breasted Sunbird</em> flitting among the proteas. Keep an eye out for <em>Cape Spurfowl</em> and <em>Southern Double-collared Sunbird</em> on the garden paths. If time permits, visit the nearby Strandfontein Wetlands – a series of sewage treatment ponds turned birding hotspot – for waterfowl such as <em>Cape Shoveler</em>, <em>South African Shelduck</em>, and possibly <em>Maccoa Duck</em>. In summer, migrant waders and flamingos may be present. Enjoy a scenic drive along Chapman’s Peak or Boyes Drive for your first taste of the Cape’s spectacular landscapes.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Target Birds:</strong> <em>Cape Sugarbird</em>, <em>Orange-breasted Sunbird</em>, <em>Southern Double-collared Sunbird</em>, <em>Cape Spurfowl</em>, <em>Egyptian Goose</em>, <em>Cape Shoveler</em>, <em>Greater Flamingo</em> (seasonal).</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Accommodation:</strong> Guesthouse in Simon’s Town (comfortable mid-range, near the birds and beach).</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg"><strong>Drive Time:</strong> ~30 min from airport to Kirstenbosch; 1 hour local drives between birding sites.</p>
</section>

    <!-- Day 2 -->
<section class="bg-zinc-100 p-6 rounded-lg shadow mt-8">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Day 2: Cape Peninsula – Cape Point to Boulders Beach</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Region &amp; Habitat:</strong> Cape Peninsula (coastal fynbos, ocean shoreline)</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Daily Outline:</strong> Devote a full day to the Cape Peninsula’s diverse birding locales. In the morning, explore the Cape Point Nature Reserve, where windswept heathlands (fynbos) meet the sea. Walk in the shadow of towering sea cliffs with panoramic ocean views. Here we target <em>Cape Rockjumper</em> – often seen bounding across rocky slopes – along with other endemics like <em>Cape Siskin</em> and <em>Victorin’s Warbler</em> in dense scrub​. The reserve’s plains host <em>Ostrich</em> and <em>Bontebok</em>, while overhead you might spot a <em>Black Harrier</em> quartering the fynbos or a <em>Verreaux’s Eagle</em> near cliff faces. After lunch, visit Boulders Beach to meet the famous colony of <em>African Penguins</em> at arm’s length. Their comical braying calls give them the nickname “jackass penguin.” Enjoy close-up photography of these endangered birds in their natural beach habitat. Late afternoon, stroll along coastal pathways in Simon’s Town or Kommetjie for <em>cormorants</em> (<em>Bank</em>, <em>Cape</em>, and <em>Crowned</em>) and the endemic <em>African Oystercatcher</em> on the rocks. Return to your Simon’s Town guesthouse for a relaxing evening by the sea.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Target Birds:</strong> <em>Cape Rockjumper</em>, <em>Cape Siskin</em>, <em>Victorin’s Warbler</em>, <em>Black Harrier</em>; <em>African Penguin</em>, <em>African Oystercatcher</em>, <em>Bank</em>, <em>Cape &amp; Crowned Cormorants</em>, <em>Hartlaub’s Gull</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Accommodation:</strong> Guesthouse in Simon’s Town (mid-range).</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg"><strong>Drive Time:</strong> ~1 hour from Simon’s Town to Cape Point (within the Peninsula); local drives otherwise.</p>
</section>

   <!-- Day 3 -->
<section class="bg-zinc-100 p-6 rounded-lg shadow mt-8">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Day 3: Overberg – Harold Porter, Rooisand &amp; Agulhas Plains</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Region &amp; Habitat:</strong> Overberg (coastal fynbos, wetlands, farmlands)</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Daily Outline:</strong> Bid farewell to the Cape Peninsula and journey into the Overberg region east of Cape Town. En route, stop at Harold Porter Botanical Garden in Betty’s Bay to seek the elusive <em>Victorin’s Warbler</em> among dense fynbos and enjoy sightings of <em>Cape Batis</em>, <em>Sombre Greenbul</em>, and sunbirds. A visit to nearby Stony Point offers another look at <em>African Penguins</em> and all four marine cormorant species at their breeding colony on the rocks. Continue over scenic mountain passes into the rural Agulhas Plain. In the afternoon, explore the Rooisand wetlands near Kleinmond or the Agulhas National Park area, where freshwater wetlands and reedbeds hold <em>African Marsh Harrier</em> and a variety of wildfowl. As you reach the open Overberg wheatbelt and Agulhas Plains, the habitat shifts to rolling farmland and renosterveld scrub. This area is famous for its <em>Blue Cranes</em> – South Africa’s national bird – often seen in pairs or flocks stalking through pastures. Watch also for <em>Denham’s Bustard</em> and <em>Southern Black Korhaan</em> displaying in the fields, and scan fence posts for <em>Jackal Buzzard</em>. By late afternoon, arrive at a country lodge or guest farm in the Overberg (near De Hoop or Agulhas) where you’ll spend the next two nights. Enjoy a farm-style dinner and fall asleep to the sounds of distant <em>Cape Eagle-Owl</em> or <em>Fiery-necked Nightjar</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Target Birds:</strong> <em>Victorin’s Warbler</em>, <em>Blue Crane</em>, <em>Denham’s Bustard</em>, <em>Southern Black Korhaan</em>, <em>African Marsh Harrier</em>, <em>Jackal Buzzard</em>, <em>Large-billed Lark</em>. (In spring, <em>Blue Cranes</em> and <em>bustards</em> are especially conspicuous on the Agulhas Plains.)</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Accommodation:</strong> Agulhas or De Hoop area lodge (mid-range guesthouse or chalets).</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg"><strong>Drive Time:</strong> ~3 hours total (Cape Town to Overberg region, with birding stops en route).</p>
</section>

    <!-- Day 4 -->
<section class="bg-zinc-100 p-6 rounded-lg shadow mt-8">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Day 4: Overberg – De Hoop Nature Reserve &amp; Agulhas Plain</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Region &amp; Habitat:</strong> Overberg (coastal reserve, sandveld fynbos, grassland/farmland)</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Daily Outline:</strong> Spend a full day immersing in the Overberg’s bird-rich habitats. In the morning, visit De Hoop Nature Reserve, a gem of the Cape’s south coast. Explore the Potberg foothills to seek the Western Cape’s only remaining <em>Cape Vulture</em> colony – an awe-inspiring sight as these huge scavengers soar overhead on thermal currents. The Potberg area’s fynbos can be home to secretive specials like <em>Protea Canary</em> and the tiny <em>Hottentot Buttonquail</em> (heard more often than seen). Next, bird around the extensive De Hoop Vlei, a Ramsar wetland that can host thousands of waterbirds in good years. Look for <em>Great White Pelican</em>, <em>Yellow-billed Duck</em>, <em>Cape Teal</em>, and perhaps a glimpse of <em>African Finfoot</em> along reedy edges. The coastal dunes and beaches of De Hoop may yield <em>Damara Tern</em> (summer) or <em>African Black Oystercatcher</em>. In the afternoon, venture back onto the Agulhas Plains: the open country here is prime for <em>Blue Crane</em> (often in family groups), <em>Denham’s Bustard</em>, <em>Karoo Korhaan</em>, and flocks of <em>White Stork</em> or <em>Cape Vulture</em> foraging if there’s a carcass. The endemic <em>Agulhas Long-billed Lark</em> is a sought-after special here – we’ll keep ears and eyes open in the native renosterveld patches for its ringing call. Seasonal highlights include fields of colorful wildflowers (especially August–September) and, in winter, the possibility of southern <em>Right Whales</em> offshore at the coast. As the day ends, return to your Overberg lodge for a second night.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Target Birds:</strong> <em>Cape Vulture</em> (Potberg colony), <em>Blue Crane</em>, <em>Denham’s (Stanley’s) Bustard</em>, <em>Agulhas Long-billed Lark</em> (endemic), <em>Cape Clapper Lark</em>, <em>Karoo Korhaan</em>, <em>Large-billed Lark</em>, <em>African Hoopoe</em>, <em>Cape Crow</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Accommodation:</strong> Agulhas or De Hoop area lodge (mid-range).</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg"><strong>Drive Time:</strong> ~1–1.5 hours local driving (round-trip to De Hoop reserve from lodge, plus local circuits on the plains).</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Region &amp; Habitat:</strong> Overberg to Tanqua Karoo (coastal route then semi-desert Karoo)</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Daily Outline:</strong> After breakfast, check out and depart the Overberg, heading northeast toward the Karoo region. If traveling in whale season (July–October), a quick stop at Cape Agulhas or the cliffs of De Hoop may reward us with southern right whale sightings just offshore. Then journey onward, possibly routing via the Whale Coast and Overstrand towns (Hermanus area) or via the farmlands of Swellendam and the Breede River valley. By midday, you’ll transit from the verdant coastal belt into the drier interior. Climb the Hex River or Tradouw Pass into the Little Karoo, noting how the habitat shifts to rocky slopes and arid scrub. In the afternoon, arrive in the vicinity of Ceres, a fruit-farming town that serves as the gateway to the Tanqua Karoo. Here, rugged mountains give way to vast open plains. We may have time for initial Karoo birding around Ceres’s outskirts or along the R355 road entering the Tankwa Karoo. This transitional area can produce <em>Protea Canary</em>, <em>Fairy Flycatcher</em>, and <em>Pririt Batis</em> in the scrub, as well as <em>Booted Eagle</em> overhead​. As we edge into true Karoo habitat, watch for the first <em>Pale Chanting Goshawk</em> perched on telephone poles and <em>Karoo Chat</em> flitting on roadside fences. Your accommodation tonight is a simple but comfortable guesthouse or farmstay on the fringe of the Tankwa Karoo (mid-range comfort in this remote area). Enjoy the stark silence and an unbelievably starry night sky after dinner – the Karoo’s low light pollution makes for excellent stargazing.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Target Birds:</strong> <em>Booted Eagle</em>, <em>Pale Chanting Goshawk</em>, <em>Pririt Batis</em>, <em>Karoo Chat</em>, <em>Mountain Wheatear</em>, <em>White-throated Canary</em>, <em>Acacia Pied Barbet</em>. (As we transition into the Karoo, we’ll start encountering many new arid-zone species.)</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Accommodation:</strong> Tankwa Karoo area farm guesthouse or lodge (mid-range, rustic comfort).</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg"><strong>Drive Time:</strong> 4–5 hours (Agulhas Plain to Ceres region, with stops). Longer if detouring via coastal route; expect a full travel day with birding stops en route.</p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Day 6: Tankwa Karoo – Endemic Riches of the Karoo</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Region &amp; Habitat:</strong> Tankwa Karoo National Park &amp; surrounds (arid scrub, desert plains)</p>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Daily Outline:</strong> Today is dedicated to the Tanqua (Tankwa) Karoo, one of Africa’s greatest endemic bird areas. We start at first light to catch the morning activity in this semi-desert environment of sparse shrubs, dry riverbeds, and distant purple mountains. In the cool hours, drive along gravel tracks scanning the stony plains for Karoo endemics. We hope to encounter the “Karoo Big 5” of birds: <em>Karoo Korhaan</em>, <em>Karoo Lark</em>, <em>Karoo Eremomela</em>, <em>Karoo Chat</em>, and <em>Karoo Long-billed Lark</em>. Many other localized species are on the menu: <em>Tractrac Chat</em>, <em>Rufous-eared Warbler</em>, and <em>Burchell’s Courser</em>. Dry riverbeds lined with acacias can harbor <em>Namaqua Warbler</em>, <em>Pririt Batis</em>, and <em>Yellow-bellied Eremomela</em>. We’ll likely hear the distinctive call of <em>Southern Fiscal</em> and the jangling song of <em>Black-headed Canary</em>. A special stop will be made at the famous Katbakkies Pass or another rocky gorge to seek the elusive <em>Cinnamon-breasted Warbler</em>. In the same crags, look for <em>Layard’s Warbler</em>, <em>Mountain Wheatear</em>, <em>Ground Woodpecker</em>, and <em>Verreaux’s Eagle</em> soaring overhead. Picnic lunch may be enjoyed at the park offices or a scenic spot in the wild. In the afternoon, bird activity slows – a good time to relax or siesta at the guesthouse. By late afternoon, we venture out again to a different section of the plains to continue our search, perhaps adding <em>Spike-heeled Lark</em>, <em>Namaqua Sandgrouse</em>, and <em>Lark-like Bunting</em>. Sunset in the Karoo is magical, with the calls of <em>Double-banded Courser</em> and barking geckos ushering in dusk. Night sky observation is again phenomenal, and we may do a short night drive to look for nocturnal critters (Cape hare, bat-eared fox) or owls like <em>Spotted Eagle-Owl</em>.</p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Day 7: Karoo to Garden Route – Montane Passes to the Coast</h3>
  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Region &amp; Habitat:</strong> Karoo to Garden Route (mountains, fynbos, coastal forest)</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Daily Outline:</strong> This morning, enjoy one last Karoo sunrise and perhaps snag any missed arid-zone species. After breakfast, begin the journey southward toward the Garden Route. The drive is long but scenic, as we leave the dry interior and traverse a series of dramatic mountain ranges dividing the Karoo from the coast. We’ll likely travel via the Koue Bokkeveld highlands and descend through the Swartberg or Outeniqua Mountains (route depends on road conditions and time). Along the way, a stop in montane fynbos could yield species like <em>Protea Canary</em> or <em>Cape Rock Thrush</em>, and we might encounter <em>Baboons</em>, <em>Klipspringers</em>, or even a <em>Cape Mountain Zebra</em> on remote passes. By midday or early afternoon, we reach the lush coastal belt of the Garden Route. The change is striking – suddenly green forests, lakes, and wetlands appear. We arrive in the town of Wilderness, a perfect base to explore the Garden Route’s birding hotspots. If time allows, we’ll begin with an afternoon visit to the Wilderness Lakes (Langvlei, Rondevlei) and estuaries. These waterbodies host <em>African Fish Eagle</em>, <em>Pied Kingfisher</em>, and a variety of herons and ducks. We’ll also look for the scarce <em>African Finfoot</em> during a boat ride or walk along the Touws River – this shy aquatic bird hides along densely vegetated riverbanks. As dusk falls, listen for the loud “Good Lord deliver us” call of the <em>Fiery-necked Nightjar</em> or perhaps a <em>Wood Owl</em> in the forest. Overnight in Wilderness in a comfortable guest lodge or hotel.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Target Birds:</strong> <em>Protea Canary</em>, <em>Cape Rock Thrush</em>, <em>African Fish Eagle</em>, <em>Malachite Kingfisher</em>, <em>African Finfoot</em>, <em>Little Egret</em>, <em>Knysna Turaco</em> (first glimpses in the forest), <em>Brown-hooded Kingfisher</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Daily Outline:</strong> Wake up to birdsong in the Garden Route. Today we delve into the indigenous forests and wetlands around Wilderness and Knysna. In the morning, explore the Woodville Big Tree forest or Wilderness National Park trails, walking under giant Yellowwood trees draped in lichens. These Afrotemperate forests are home to an exciting array of forest bird specialties. We’ll be on alert for the vibrant <em>Knysna Turaco</em>, with its flashing red wings as it glides between trees, and the elusive <em>Narina Trogon</em>, often located by its low hooting call. Other targets include the <em>Knysna Woodpecker</em> (a local endemic that taps softly on dead branches), <em>Olive Woodpecker</em>, and forest-dwelling flycatchers. The <em>Chorister Robin-Chat</em> may serenade us from the undergrowth, while flocks of <em>Swee Waxbill</em> and <em>Forest Canary</em> feed quietly in the shadows. We’ll also look for <em>Forest Buzzard</em> circling above and listen for the loud <em>Olive Bushshrike</em> dueting from dense foliage. In the afternoon, visit Rondevlei Hide or take a flat-water boat ride on the Wilderness lagoon for waterbirds and a second chance at <em>African Finfoot</em> and maybe <em>Half-collared Kingfisher</em>. Alternatively, we can drive to Knysna and visit the Knysna Estuary and salt marsh, where species like <em>African Black Oystercatcher</em>, <em>Grey Plover</em>, and <em>Greater Flamingo</em> (seasonal) can be seen, alongside picturesque views of the Knysna Heads. By evening, return to your Wilderness accommodation. You might opt for a nocturnal walk to spot Knysna Dwarf Chameleon or hear night birds; <em>Buff-spotted Flufftail</em> and <em>Wood Owl</em> are resident, though more often heard than seen.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Daily Outline:</strong> This morning you may have the option to visit additional forest patches or coastal fynbos to seek any remaining target species. A short hike in the Knysna Forest could yield <em>Scaly-throated Honeyguide</em> or <em>Grey Cuckooshrike</em>, while roadside birding in fynbos might produce the endemic <em>Victorin’s Warbler</em> or <em>Orange-breasted Sunbird</em> if not already seen. We’ll then consider a trip toward the Tsitsikamma section of the Garden Route, east of Knysna. At Nature’s Valley, a beautiful combination of lagoon, beach, and forest, we can look for <em>Crowned Eagle</em> soaring above and <em>Black-bellied Starling</em> or <em>Green-backed Camaroptera</em> in thickets. The seaside vegetation might reveal <em>Cape Siskin</em> or <em>Collared Sunbird</em>. After enjoying this bird-rich paradise and maybe a lunch with ocean views, we begin wrapping up the Cape portion of our tour. Later in the afternoon, drive to George Airport (or Plettenberg Bay airport if available) to catch a domestic flight linking us to the Kruger segment. We plan for an evening flight from George to Nelspruit (Mbombela) – a roughly 2-hour flight that leaps us across the country from the Indian Ocean coast to the edge of Kruger Park. Upon arrival at Mbombela’s Kruger Mpumalanga Airport, transfer to a nearby hotel or safari lodge in the Lowveld (perhaps in White River or near one of Kruger’s southern gates). Note: Depending on flight schedules, we might instead fly to Johannesburg this evening and overnight there, connecting to Kruger by road or air next morning. In either case, today is a transitional day to position us for the Kruger adventure.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Target Birds:</strong> (morning in Garden Route) <em>Knysna Turaco</em>, <em>Olive Woodpecker</em>, <em>Black-headed Oriole</em>, <em>African Paradise Flycatcher</em>, <em>Terrestrial Brownbul</em>; (Nature’s Valley) <em>Crowned Eagle</em>, <em>Knysna Turaco</em>, <em>Emerald Cuckoo</em> (summer), <em>Black-bellied Starling</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Daily Outline:</strong> [This day is partially covered in Day 9 description – use as needed based on flight timing.] You’ll transfer from the Garden Route to the Kruger region. Most likely, a midday or afternoon flight from George to Mbombela (Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport) will be taken, allowing some final morning birding in the Garden Route (as described on Day 9). Upon arriving in Mpumalanga province, meet your Kruger-area guide/driver (if different) and settle into a lodge at the edge of Greater Kruger National Park. Prepare for the change in environment: you are now in the subtropical savanna, with entirely new bird communities. Around the lodge gardens you might spot your first <em>Purple-crested Turaco</em> or hear the “good-night” chirp of <em>Southern White-faced Scops-Owl</em>.

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Daily Outline:</strong> Rise early to enter Kruger National Park, one of Africa’s premier wildlife reserves. We begin in the southern section, known for its bounty of animals and dense birdlife. After formalities at the gate (such as Malelane or Crocodile Bridge gate), we venture on game drive routes along the Crocodile River and bushveld loops. The mix of acacia woodlands, open grassland, and riverine forest here provides habitat for a wide array of birds. By now, the calls of <em>Woodland Kingfisher</em> (in summer) and the loud “Go-away” squawk of the <em>Grey Go-away-bird</em> will become familiar background sounds. We’ll search for iconic Kruger birds like the <em>Southern Ground Hornbill</em> striding through the grass, <em>Bateleur</em> and <em>Martial Eagle</em> soaring overhead, and colorful gems such as <em>Lilac-breasted Roller</em> and <em>Southern Carmine Bee-eater</em> (summer visitor). Along the rivers, keep an eye out for <em>Saddle-billed Stork</em> and <em>Yellow-billed Stork</em>, as well as <em>Water Thick-knee</em> on the shores. Raptor diversity is high – today could yield <em>Brown Snake Eagle</em>, <em>African Fish Eagle</em>, <em>Wahlberg’s Eagle</em>, and vulture species like <em>White-backed</em> and <em>Hooded Vulture</em>. We’ll make stops to stretch our legs at designated rest areas or hides overlooking waterholes, where we might quietly observe giraffes, elephants, Burchell’s zebras, and buffalo coming to drink, alongside waterbirds like <em>African Spoonbill</em> or <em>Black Heron</em>. Big game encounters are a highlight here: this region of Kruger is known for frequent sightings of white rhino, lion prides, and large elephant herds. The birding continues as we approach Lower Sabie Rest Camp, our likely base in southern Kruger. The Sabie River view near camp often has <em>Goliath Heron</em>, <em>Great Egret</em>, hippos, and crocodiles. Check the camp grounds for resident <em>Brown-headed Parrots</em>, <em>Red-billed Buffalo-Weaver</em>, and roosting fruit bats in the trees. After an exciting day, relax at camp in the evening – perhaps enjoying a night drive (optional) with the chance to spot nightjars, <em>Verreaux’s Eagle-Owl</em>, or <em>Pennant-winged Nightjar</em> (in summer).</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Daily Outline:</strong> Spend another full day in southern Kruger, shifting focus to the Sabie River and Skukuza area. The Sabie River is one of Kruger’s lifelines, lined with sycamore figs and mahogany trees that create pockets of gallery forest. In the early morning, take a drive along the Sabie River Loop where we aim to find the shy <em>African Finfoot</em> and <em>Half-collared Kingfisher</em> along quiet backwaters. At sunrise, waterbirds like <em>Black-crowned Night Heron</em> and <em>Giant Kingfisher</em> patrol the riverbanks. Continuing upriver, we reach Skukuza, the park’s headquarters. The camp’s gardens and surrounding thorn thickets are surprisingly rich in birds – <em>Purple-crested Turaco</em> and <em>Brown-headed Parrot</em> in fruiting trees, <em>Scarlet-chested Sunbird</em> in blooming aloes, and <em>Bushveld Pipit</em> or <em>Bearded Scrub-Robin</em> in the understory. We’ll check the Skukuza nursery or golf club area for the endemic <em>Southern White-crowned Shrike</em> and <em>Retz’s Helmetshrike</em> flocks moving through acacias. By late morning, take a break (perhaps enjoy brunch at Skukuza with a view of the river – hippos and vervet monkeys as entertainment). In the afternoon, we drive northward toward the central savannas. The habitat opens into expansive marula and knobthorn woodlands as we approach the Satara region. This is classic African bushveld, home to species like <em>Burchell’s Starling</em>, <em>Cape Glossy Starling</em>, and raptors such as <em>Dark Chanting Goshawk</em>. With luck, we might spot the elegant <em>Cheetah</em> scanning for prey on these open plains or a herd of <em>African Buffalo</em> grazing. Birding en route, we could encounter the stately <em>Kori Bustard</em> (world’s heaviest flying bird) stepping through the grass, or flush a covey of <em>Coqui Francolin</em> from the roadside. By evening, arrive at <em>Satara Rest Camp</em> in central Kruger, known as “cat country” for its frequent lion and leopard sightings. Satara’s lawns often host <em>Helmeted Guineafowl</em> and <em>African Scops-Owl</em> can be heard at night. Enjoy a dinner in camp and perhaps a short night walk inside the camp perimeter to spot <em>Large-spotted Genet</em> or listen for <em>Square-tailed Nightjar</em>.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Daily Outline:</strong> Awake in central Kruger where the dawn chorus might include the distant booming of a <em>Southern Ground Hornbill</em> and the cooing of <em>Cape Turtle Doves</em>. Today we explore the Satara area thoroughly, including loops that cover open grassland savannas and denser mopaneveld toward the north. The central region is a stronghold for many large birds. We stand a good chance of seeing <em>Ostrich</em>, <em>Secretarybird</em>, and <em>Southern Ground Hornbill</em> striding across the plains, as well as bustards like <em>Kori Bustard</em> and the smaller <em>Black-bellied Bustard</em>. After early morning coffee, we might head out along the S100 N’wanetsi River road – a famous route for both birds and big cats. Along this road, look for flocks of <em>Red-billed Quelea</em> (sometimes in the thousands), <em>Chestnut-backed Sparrow-Lark</em> on the road edges, and raptors drawn to this abundance such as <em>Lanner Falcon</em> or <em>Yellow-billed Kite</em> (summer). Waterholes could have <em>Double-banded Sandgrouse</em> coming to drink or <em>Namaqua Dove</em>. The thorn thickets here host <em>Black-headed Oriole</em>, <em>Long-billed Crombec</em>, and <em>Burnt-necked Eremomela</em>, while dry woodland holds the likes of <em>Southern Yellow-billed Hornbill</em> at almost every turn. We’ll take the day to cover several productive loops, possibly including a visit to N’wanetsi Picnic Spot (scenic lookout) and the Sweni Hide, where we might find <em>African Openbill Stork</em> or common ostrich near the water. The mopane woodlands north-east of Satara are home to <em>Natal Spurfowl</em>, <em>Arrow-marked Babbler</em>, and if we are very fortunate, the stately <em>Saddle-billed Stork</em> in marshy spots. Throughout the day, of course, we remain alert for mammals: Satara’s zone often yields lions, spotted hyenas, elephants, and large herds of plains zebra and blue wildebeest. Keep an eye on the sky for <em>White-backed Vultures</em> circling and the striking <em>Bateleur</em> with its rocking flight. In the late afternoon, we might take a slower drive back to camp to enjoy a dip in the camp pool during the heat of the day. As this is our last night in Kruger, consider joining an evening game drive or simply soaking up the sounds of nature one final night – the roar of a distant lion or the “whoop” of hyenas echoing across the dark.</p>

  <p class="text-black text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg mb-4"><strong>Daily Outline:</strong> This morning, enjoy a final game drive in Kruger at dawn. We can take one last loop around Satara or en route to the exit gate, trying to add any species we might have missed. Perhaps we’ll get lucky with a <em>Bronze-winged Courser</em> on the road at first light, or finally spot the beautiful <em>Lilac-breasted Roller</em> in perfect light. After saying goodbye to Kruger’s wild inhabitants, we exit the park by late morning. From here, begin the journey to Johannesburg, which takes about 5–6 hours by road. We plan stops along the way to break up the drive. One option (time permitting) is the scenic Panorama Route through Mpumalanga’s escarpment: this affords stunning views at sites like Blyde River Canyon and a taste of highveld grassland birding. On the escarpment, look for <em>Long-crested Eagle</em> on utility poles, <em>Jackal Buzzard</em>, or <em>Cape Vulture</em> at a cliff lookout. Another stop could be at a highland grassland area to seek <em>White-necked Raven</em> or <em>Denham’s Bustard</em>. If time is short, we will take the faster highway route with a lunch stop in a small town en route.
