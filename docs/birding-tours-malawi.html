    The Warm Heart of Africa for Birders
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Malawi likes to describe itself as “The Warm Heart of Africa,” a nickname earned through the genuine friendliness and warmth of its people​. Travelers quickly feel at home here – smiling villagers, vibrant local markets, and a rich cultural heritage make every journey special. This welcoming atmosphere sets the tone for a birding tour that is as much about people and place as it is about birds.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      As one of Africa’s smaller countries, Malawi surprises visitors with its astonishing ecological diversity. Within its borders you’ll find Great Rift Valley lakes, expansive wetlands, miombo woodlands, and misty highlands. This range of habitats is carried to an extreme, resulting in over 650 species of birds recorded in Malawi’s comparatively small area​ – an impressive number that promises birders a new surprise at each turn. In fact, Malawi’s avifauna is quite distinct from the drier regions of southern Africa, with many species here at the edge of their ranges or easier to spot than in neighboring countries. The country has only one true endemic bird (the endangered Yellow-throated Apalis found in southern montane forests​), but it hosts a wealth of regional specialties and migratory visitors. From November to April, migratory birds arrive from Eurasia, adding even more variety to the checklist​.

    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Malawi’s landscapes are as enchanting as its birdlife. Picture yourself on the shores of Lake Malawi (the third-largest lake in Africa), listening to the cry of an African Fish Eagle as fishermen launch their wooden canoes at dawn. Or imagine strolling through a sun-dappled forest in the highlands, the air filled with the calls of turacos and babblers.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">

      The country’s topography ranges from the low-lying lake basin to high plateaus like Nyika over 2,000 m (6,600 ft) above sea level, offering sweeping vistas. In the highlands, patches of evergreen forest cling to mountainsides, harboring elusive warblers and trogons, while orchids and wildflowers speckle the grasslands​. Down in the valleys, rivers like the Shire weave through baobab-studded savanna, drawing elephants, antelope, and a chorus of birdlife. Good roads and a safe, friendly environment make travel in Malawi a pleasure​. A typical birding tour here will span the length of the country, uncovering its natural jewels and cultural delights. Below, we’ll journey through some of the must-visit destinations on Malawi birding tours – each stop showcasing a unique facet of Malawi’s birdlife, scenery, and charm.

      Lilongwe
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Malawi’s birding adventures often begin in Lilongwe, the nation’s capital city nestled in the central region. Lilongwe offers a gentle introduction to the country’s landscapes and people. Despite being a capital, it’s a surprisingly green city: patches of acacia woodland, gardens, and the Lilongwe River meandering through give it a relaxed, semi-rural feel. You might wake up on your first morning to the sound of doves cooing and thrushes singing in the hotel garden.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
    In the suburbs, Lilongwe Nature Sanctuary (also called the Wildlife Centre) provides an early taste of Malawi’s wildlife. Here, on a stroll along wooded trails by the river, you can spot colorful birds even within the city. Lilongwe is known to harbor species like the Olive Sunbird and the secretive Red-throated Twinspot in its urban sanctuary – a delightful surprise to find in the middle of a capital city. Vervet monkeys chatter in the trees, and you might catch a glimpse of bushbuck deer or a monitor lizard near the water, reminding you that even the city lives up to Malawi’s wild richness. Lilongwe is also the gateway to Malawi’s culture; birders can explore craft markets or enjoy a meal of local Chambo fish, all while soaking up the friendly Malawian hospitality that makes every visitor feel welcome.

      Kumbali Country Lodge
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Just outside Lilongwe, set on a 650-hectare private reserve and dairy farm, lies Kumbali Country Lodge – a favorite first (or last) stop on many birding itineraries​. This tranquil lodge is a destination in itself, offering a soft landing in Malawi’s bush. The grounds are lush and bird-filled, with well-tended gardens, woodlands, and even a small game reserve on the property. Guests wake to the sound of dawn choruses in the trees and enjoy views of wooded hills from their verandas. The lodge’s farm grows its own produce, and the farm-to-table meals are often raved about by visitors.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      But for birders, the real treat is stepping out into Kumbali’s trails. Bird watching is a fun way to while away time in the sunshine here, in their extensive forest reserve​. You can encounter a huge variety of garden and woodland birds on an easy walk: listen for the liquid calls of turacos and barbets, watch weavers and sunbirds flit among the flowering bushes, or perhaps spot a Spotted Eagle-Owl roosting. In fact, the lodge has a few resident owls that have taken up home in the thatched roofs – “including owls which permanently reside in the dining room ceiling” as the lodge notes!​. It’s a magical experience to dine by lamplight with the soft hoots of an owl overhead. Kumbali’s reserve has also been stocked with some savannah wildlife – you might see a small group of zebra or antelope like sable and impala grazing in the distance on a guided nature walk​. It’s the perfect spot to recover from a long flight and get one’s first taste of Malawi’s warm heart and natural beauty, all in one place.

      Lilongwe Wildlife Centre
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      In the heart of Lilongwe, the Lilongwe Wildlife Centre (also known as the Nature Sanctuary) offers birders an oasis of greenery and conservation. This award-winning wildlife rescue and education center is set in a 180-hectare tract of woodland right in the city. Walking the shaded trails here, you could easily forget you’re minutes from government offices and city shops. The mix of riverine forest and thornbush within the sanctuary creates habitats for many species. Birdwatching is a highlight at the Centre – it’s noted as a must-visit spot for birding in Malawi’s capital​. Patience and quiet observation might reward you with sightings of the Olive Sunbird, a shimmering green-and-grey nectar lover that flits through the foliage. On the forest floor, keep an eye out for the Red-throated Twinspot, a tiny finch with scarlet breast patches known to hop in the undergrowth here​. These are special finds for an urban location. Over 100 bird species have been recorded in the sanctuary, from bee-eaters and kingfishers along the Lingadzi River to woodland kingfishers and cuckoos in the trees.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Beyond birds, the Wildlife Centre is home to various rescued animals – you might see baboons, monkeys, or antelopes that are rehabilitated here, and occasionally larger animals under care (the Centre has rehabilitated servals and even lions in the past). As you wander, you’ll likely encounter troops of vervet monkeys scampering in the canopy and maybe a family of warthogs snuffling in the underbrush. Interpretive signs and viewing hides make it easy to enjoy the wildlife. Visiting the Lilongwe Wildlife Centre not only gives you great birding and photography opportunities, but also a chance to learn about Malawi’s conservation efforts. All proceeds support wildlife rescue, embodying Malawi’s commitment to protecting its natural heritage even amid urban growth. It’s a refreshing stop that balances the excitement of an upcoming wilderness tour with a gentle introduction to Malawi’s flora and fauna.

      Dzalanyama Forest Reserve 
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Leaving Lilongwe, many birding tours head to the Dzalanyama Forest Reserve, a vast expanse of miombo woodland about an hour or two southwest of the city. As you ascend into Dzalanyama’s rolling hills, the habitat changes to miombo – a Brachystegia-dominated dry woodland that is one of Africa’s richest bird habitats. At first glance, miombo forest can seem quiet and endless, but birders know that patience here pays off in golden encounters. Dzalanyama is often cited as Malawi’s top miombo birding site, and indeed it is “of great interest to birders” for its plethora of special species​. Walking through the warm woodland, you might suddenly hear chirps and fluttering – the sign of a mixed feeding flock moving through. Miombo birds often travel in multi-species bands, and once you find such a flock, the sightings come in a rush. Drongos and tits lead the way while woodpeckers, cuckoos, flycatchers, and warblers follow in their wake​, all foraging frantically. It’s a thrilling moment for even seasoned birdwatchers.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      At Dzalanyama, there are several sought-after “miombo specialist” birds with limited ranges. Keen birders hope to spot the Stierling’s Woodpecker, a subtly-marked woodpecker found almost only in miombo woodlands of south-central Africa​. The reserve is one of the best places to find it. Also on the wishlist is the Boulder Chat, a chat (thrush-like bird) that lives around rocky outcrops – Dzalanyama’s granite boulders sometimes have a pair of these curious charcoal-colored birds singing atop them​. As you continue, you might glimpse a flash of red and blue: that could be Anchieta’s Sunbird (also called the Red-and-blue Sunbird), feeding on mistletoe blooms. Flocks of seedeaters and waxbills forage in the grasses; among them the Black-eared Seedeater and Red-capped Crombec are notable finds​. Predatory birds are around too – listen for the ringing calls of Southern Ground Hornbills or the plaintive whistle of a African Cuckoo-Hawk gliding overhead. One coveted bird here is the Sousa’s Shrike, a rare and striking grey-white bushshrike that Malawi birders treasure​. With luck, an expert local guide will know the territories where these birds often skulk.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Beyond its birds, Dzalanyama charms visitors with its serene atmosphere. Butterflies dance along the paths, and the scent of wild miombo blossoms fills the air in the rainy season. Small streams flow through the reserve, where you might take a break and find more birds – perhaps a Bushshrike taking a drink or a Kingfisher hunting for frogs. As evening falls, the woodland comes alive with the sounds of nightjars and owls. Staying overnight at a simple forest lodge, one drifts off to the distant hoot of a Wood Owl and the clear night sky studded with stars. Dzalanyama is a true birder’s paradise, offering a deep immersion into Malawi’s woodland avifauna and a peaceful retreat in nature.

      Zomba Plateau
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Heading southward, the landscape of Malawi rises again at the Zomba Plateau – a large table-top mountain in the southern part of the country. The plateau, reaching about 2,085 m (6,840 ft) at its peak, is an entirely different world of cool misty forests, pine plantations, and sweeping vistas. Once the site of Malawi’s colonial capital, Zomba town at the foot of the mountain has historical charm, but for birders the real allure is ascending the plateau’s winding road into the Zomba Forest Reserve. Much of the plateau is covered in plantations now, but pockets of montane evergreen forest and riverine jungle remain, harboring some of Malawi’s most sought-after birds​.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      One such jewel is the White-winged Apalis, a beautiful black-and-yellow warbler with bold white wing patches. This species is near-threatened and found only in a few highland forests of Malawi and Tanzania – Zomba Plateau is one of the places it survives​. Lucky birders might catch a glimpse of a male apalis flitting through the canopy, flashing its wings and singing a high, thin song. Even rarer, the plateau holds the Thyolo Alethe, a shy brown-backed thrush-like bird endemic to Malawi’s southern forests. Sightings of the alethe are elusive (it hides in dense undergrowth), but just knowing such an endangered endemic is nearby adds to the excitement. More commonly, Zomba’s forests offer delights like the Bar-tailed Trogon, a gorgeous red-and-green bird that sits motionless on vines – until it swoops to snatch an insect with extraordinary quickness. Colorful sunbirds such as the Ludwig’s Double-collared Sunbird and Olive-headed Sunbird sip nectar from flowering bushes​. The calls of Trumpeter Hornbills echo through the valleys, and troops of Samango monkeys (blue monkeys) rustle in the treetops, occasionally knocking down a cascade of leaves. This plateau was once rich in wildlife – it’s said that up to 30 years ago, herds of antelope roamed here​ – but today you are more likely to find only smaller creatures: duikers dashing across the path or rock dassies sunning on boulders.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Zomba Plateau’s scenery is simply breathtaking. Birders will want to take in the famous viewpoints like Chingwe’s Hole or Queen’s View, where one can gaze out over the plains stretching to Lake Chilwa and Mozambique in the distance. Waterfalls such as Williams Falls and Mandala Falls tumble off the plateau, their spray nourishing ferns and creating glades where forest birds gather. In the early morning, the plateau is often cloaked in mists, with the aroma of wildflowers and moss. By mid-day, sunshine breaks through, illuminating butterflies and the bright plumage of birds. Montane species like the Orange Ground-Thrush scratch in the leaf litter, and Green-headed Orioles whistle mellow notes from fig trees​. Every moment on Zomba Plateau feels enchanted – it’s a mix of natural wonder and a touch of colonial-era history (with an old mountain inn and remnants of past estates) that gives it a unique character. For birders, it’s an essential stop to seek montane forest specials and to simply revel in a cool highland haven.

      Liwonde National Park
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Liwonde National Park is often the crown jewel of Malawi’s wildlife destinations – a park that offers an exhilarating mix of classic African big game and superb birdwatching. Located in the south along the Shire River, Liwonde is a relatively small park (about 548 km²) but packs in a tremendous density of animals along its waterways and savannas. As you enter the park, you’re greeted by the sight of Borassus palm trees and groves of fever trees lining the river, and perhaps a herd of impala or waterbuck bounding away. Liwonde’s animal populations have rebounded impressively under dedicated conservation management, and today it’s common to see African elephants roaming in large numbers. (Indeed, Liwonde is one of the best places in Malawi to see elephants – they are common and often seen bathing or browsing in the marshes​.) On a drive or boat safari, you might also spot sable antelope, hippos (by the hundreds!), crocodiles, warthogs, and even reintroduced cheetahs or lions lounging in the shade. Birding in Liwonde is extraordinary from the moment you get on the water: taking a boat safari on the Shire River is a highlight of any visit. As you glide along, flocks of African Openbill Storks work the shallows, Pied Kingfishers hover and dive for fish, and the haunting cry of the African Fish Eagle echoes from the trees – you are likely to see these majestic fish eagles perched every few hundred meters, as “fish eagles…are never far away” in this habitat​.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Liwonde is particularly famed for certain “special” birds that are hard to find elsewhere. Birders coming to Liwonde often have a checklist that includes Böhm’s Bee-eater, a lovely orange-throated bee-eater that prefers the park’s dense riverine thickets, Brown-breasted Barbet, a chunky fruit-eating bird with a loud knock-knock call, and Lilian’s Lovebird, a small green and peach parrot which flocks in the mopane woodlands​. All three of these species reach the core of their range in Liwonde, making the park a must-visit. A skilled guide can usually help locate chattering groups of Lilian’s Lovebirds feeding in seeding grasses or point out a Böhm’s Bee-eater sallying after insects from a high branch. Liwonde’s guides are also famously adept at finding the Pel’s Fishing Owl – this giant ginger-colored owl is a coveted sight for birders. At dusk, you might drift along the river and have a guide whisper and point: there, tucked in the canopy, a huge owl with glowing eyes peers back. Local knowledge often leads visitors to a day-roosting Pel’s Fishing Owl, allowing a rare daytime view of this nocturnal hunter​. Another elusive resident is the White-backed Night Heron, sometimes seen along quiet channels at the water’s edge near camps​.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Daytime birding in Liwonde yields an endless parade of sightings. Brilliant Malachite Kingfishers dart like flying gems. Hornbills (including the impressive Ground Hornbill and cheeky Red-billed Hornbill) are common in the woodland glades​. Raptors soar overhead – keep an eye out for the elegant Bateleur with its teetering flight or a Martial Eagle riding thermals​. In palm trees, the small Dickinson’s Kestrel may be perched, and Palm-nut Vultures (unusual vultures that eat palm fruit) also occur in the area​. Along the riverbanks, African Jacanas tip-toe on lily pads and flocks of White-faced Whistling Ducks take to wing when disturbed. A bird list for Liwonde can easily top 300 species, but it’s not just the numbers – it’s the experience of seeing them among such abundant wildlife. One moment you’re watching a Collared Palm-Thrush hop around your lodge veranda (they are “garden birds” at camps like Mvuu​), and the next you’re startled by a splash as a pod of hippos grunts nearby.

    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Evenings in Liwonde are magical. As the sun sets over the river, thousands of waterbirds fly in to roost. You might hear the distant “goodnight” calls of doves and the distinctive “whoop” of hyenas starting their night. Night drives can reveal Square-tailed Nightjars fluttering up from the tracks and African Scops Owls calling from tree stumps​. Meanwhile, the southern sky overhead is brilliant with stars. By conserving its wildlife and welcoming visitors, Liwonde embodies Malawi’s commitment to its natural treasures. It’s an essential stop on any Malawi birding tour – a place where one can tick off dozens of bird species in a day, and also simply enjoy the thrill of classic African safari moments, like watching an elephant herd crossing the river at sunset with egrets perched on their backs.

      Nyika Plateau National Park
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      From the lowlands of Vwaza, many birding itineraries ascend to the Nyika National Park, entering an entirely new realm of Malawi’s ecology – the high Nyika Plateau. Covering a vast area of 3,200 km², Nyika is Malawi’s largest national park and sits at the northern end of Lake Malawi’s basin, straddling the Malawi-Zambia border​. The name Nyika means “where the water comes from”​, a testament to the plateau’s crucial role as a water catchment: misty rains and montane bogs here feed rivers that flow to Lake Malawi and beyond. As you climb the single dirt road into Nyika, you’ll notice the air cooling and the vegetation changing to grasslands and heath dotted with wildflowers and protea bushes​. The landscape is often described as looking more like the Scottish Highlands or a European meadow than typical Africa – endless rolling hills of grass, rocky outcrops, and pockets of evergreen forest in the folds of the terrain​. It’s a stunning panorama, especially in the early morning when the mist lifts to reveal herds of animals grazing on the plains.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Nyika’s wildlife has a distinctive cast, with several species adapted to the high altitude environment. It is one of the few places in Africa where you can see large herds of Roan Antelope, a stately horse-like antelope with swept-back horns, calmly roaming the hillsides. Alongside them, the Crawshay’s Zebra (a subspecies of plains zebra unique to this region) graze in family groups, their black-and-white stripes stark against the green background​. You’ll also likely encounter Eland, the largest antelope, appearing in imposing numbers; Nyika’s eland are known to be quite approachable. Reedbuck are common in the damper valleys, and Bushbuck surprisingly venture out of the forests to feed in the open here (less shy than usual)​. Among the rocks, look for the nimble Klipspringer, a tiny antelope that hops on tiptoe on the boulders​. Nyika also has a healthy population of leopards – indeed, it’s reputed to have one of the highest densities of leopards in south-central Africa, though these spotted cats are masters of stealth and are only “occasionally seen” by visitors​. Still, the possibility of a leopard slinking in the twilight or leaving pug marks on a trail adds an air of excitement to every hike or drive.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      For birders, Nyika is legendary. The plateau hosts several species that are hard to find elsewhere or that are entirely absent from the lowlands. One of the stars is the Blue Swallow, a migratory swallow with glossy dark-blue plumage that breeds in the highland grasslands. The Blue Swallow is endangered globally, but on Nyika it is easy to see, flitting gracefully over the open hills and valleys​. Seeing a pair of Blue Swallows dipping low over a misty valley is often a trip highlight. Another special is the Denham’s Bustard, a large, ground-dwelling bird of open country which still wanders Nyika’s grasslands in small numbers​. Although bustards have vanished from some other parts of Malawi, on Nyika you might spot one majestically striding through the moorland, head held high. The park also once had Wattled Cranes and Secretarybirds, though these appear to have disappeared in recent years​. Nonetheless, the plateau’s wetlands can still yield surprises like the Red-winged Francolin, found in moist grass, or the Yellow-browed Seedeater, a little finch that hides in seeding grasses and shrubbery​.

    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Nyika’s wildflower-carpeted slopes are dotted with patches of montane evergreen forest in sheltered areas and stream gullies. These forest patches are treasure troves of highland forest birds, often species that are localized to just a few high mountains in Africa. With patience, birders search for furtive denizens like the White-chested Alethe and Sharpe’s Akalat, both shy, ground-loving birds with rich songs that emanate from the thickets. The Black-browed Greenbul and Sharpe’s Greenbul (two similar forest bulbuls) flit about in the mid-canopy, while the Olive-flanked Ground Robin (also called Olive-flanked Robin-Chat) whistles its melancholy tune from dense bracken​. One may glimpse the Chapin’s Apalis, a tiny warbler, or hear the duetting calls of Fülleborn’s Boubou, a mountain boubou shrike restricted to this region​. It can take time to coax these birds into view, but the effort is part of what makes birding on Nyika so rewarding – it feels like a true exploration. Meanwhile, more conspicuous birds add color: in the protea patches, brilliant scarlet blooms attract sunbirds like the Whyte’s Double-collared Sunbird (a Nyika specialty with iridescent plumage) and the stunning Scarlet-tufted Sunbird, a high-altitude nectar feeder that is very hard to find elsewhere in its range​. In the wet season, male Montane Widowbirds adorn the grasslands, jet-black with long flowing tail feathers that they display in flight to impress females​.

    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Birding aside, simply being on the Nyika Plateau is an experience of peace and grandeur. Visibility can stretch for dozens of kilometers on a clear day – rolling green hills under expansive skies, with perhaps the glint of a distant herd of antelope or a solitary safari vehicle raising a trail of dust. During the day, you might encounter orchids and gladiolus flowers in bloom, evidence of the plateau’s rich flora​. By afternoon, clouds often build, and a brief rain shower might sweep across, followed by a rainbow arcing over the grasslands. In the evenings, many visitors enjoy a sundowner drink at a viewpoint, watching the sun sink into golden clouds over the high country. As night falls, the temperature drops sharply (pack a sweater for Nyika!), and the plateau reveals yet another wonder: its nightlife. Spotted Eagle-Owls call from rocky perches, Marsh Owls quarter low over the grass looking for rodents​, and one might spot the localized Ruwenzori Nightjar hawking moths along dirt tracks (the form here might even be a distinct subspecies or species, sometimes called Usambara Nightjar). The darkness is deep, with minimal light pollution, so the Milky Way glitters overhead. On a night drive back to camp, there’s a chance of seeing nocturnal mammals like the Side-striped Jackal or a Porcupine trundling across the road​.

    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Nyika National Park truly feels like “Malawi’s highland sanctuary” – a place where nature reigns in cool, quiet splendor. Whether you’re chasing a lifer bird species or simply soaking in the scenery among zebras and wildflowers, Nyika leaves an indelible impression. It showcases the unexpected side of Malawi’s environment and caps off the northern birding circuit with a flourish.

      Nkhata Bay & Surroundings
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      After the mountains of Nyika, many birding tours descend back toward the great lake, stopping at Nkhata Bay on Malawi’s northern lakeshore. Nkhata Bay is both a town and the name of the surrounding bay – a picturesque inlet of Lake Malawi known for its crystal-clear waters, sandy beaches, and verdant hills. Arriving here feels almost like coming to a tropical island coast. The town of Nkhata Bay has a lively, laid-back vibe: fishing boats bob in the harbor, local markets buzz with people selling fruit and freshly caught fish, and the sound of reggae or local music drifts from the lakeside lodges. For a birder (or any traveler), Nkhata Bay offers a delightful change of pace – it’s a place to slow down, enjoy the lake views, and still find plenty of birdlife around.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      The northern lakeshore is very green and lush, dotted with fishing villages and endless sandy beaches. Tall coconut palms, mango and baobab trees, and patches of rainforest cling to the slopes that rise from the lake, providing habitat for various birds. While enjoying a lunch of grilled chambo fish by the water, you might notice Yellow-throated Longclaws (a grassland bird with a bright yellow throat) strutting on the lawns or a pair of Tropical Boubous calling back and forth from the shrubbery. Over the lake itself, Pied Kingfishers hover and dive with clockwork regularity, and along rocky shores White-breasted Cormorants and Little Egrets can be seen drying their wings or stalking small fish. One iconic bird of the lakeshore that you’re almost guaranteed to spot is the African Fish Eagle – they nest in the tall trees near villages and are often heard with their ringing call. Watching a fish eagle swoop down near a group of local fishermen paddling their dugout canoe is a quintessential Malawi sight. In fact, at Nkhata Bay you get to witness the beautiful coexistence of people and nature: as fishermen mend their nets on the beach, egrets and herons gather hoping for scraps; children play in the shallows while Wire-tailed Swallows skim low over the water catching insects.

    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      If you venture a bit outside the town, you can explore patches of lowland forest or rubber and tea plantations in the nearby hills (the region produces tea and rubber, and those estates often have remnant forest). In these areas, one might find African Paradise Flycatchers – males trailing long orange tails as they flit through shady groves – and hear the loud “koo-koo-koo” of Trumpeter Hornbills flying between fruiting trees. Colorful Sunbirds such as the Collared Sunbird or Variable Sunbird sip nectar from flowering hibiscus in village gardens. Perhaps you’ll spot a Palm-nut Vulture perched atop a palm tree; these striking black-and-white raptors are common near lakeshore communities, feeding on palm fruits and the occasional fish. At dusk, a chorus of Fiery-necked Nightjars might start their haunting “good Lord deliver us” calls from the woodlands, while clouds of bats emerge to feast on insects over the water.


    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Nkhata Bay isn’t about chasing rare endemic birds – it’s about immersing in the lakeside environment, where everyday bird sightings are nonetheless delightful. You’ll likely check off a good number of common species here, adding to your trip list: for instance, Brown-throated Weavers weaving their nests in the reeds, African Harrier-Hawks (Gymnogene) scanning cliff sides for nesting birds to raid, or Pied Mannikins and Bronze Mannikins (small finches) twittering in the bushes. Many tours use Nkhata Bay as a pleasant rest stop for a night or two, giving travelers a chance to swim or snorkel in Lake Malawi’s warm waters (the lake is famous for its myriad of colorful cichlid fish). Snorkeling among the endemic cichlids – each bay has its own spectrum of neon blue, yellow, and striped fish – is like birding underwater, an exploration of Malawi’s biodiversity in a different realm.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      Culturally, Nkhata Bay allows birders to meet local Malawians in a day-to-day setting – perhaps visiting a community project or just chatting with the friendly lodge staff and guides. You might learn about the fishing traditions on the lake, passed down through generations. At night, the horizon of Lake Malawi twinkles with the lanterns of fishermen – David Livingstone once famously dubbed Malawi “The Lake of Stars” upon seeing these lights reflected, and indeed the sight is enchanting. Sitting by the shore under the stars, with the sound of gentle waves and maybe distant singing from a village, one can appreciate the profound serenity of this place. It’s a perfect penultimate stop, allowing you to reflect on all the environments – and birds – you’ve experienced across Malawi, from mountain to lake.

      Lake Malawi
    </h2>
    <p class="text-md sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg">
      No Malawi birding tour would be complete without celebrating Lake Malawi itself. This vast lake is the dominant geographic feature of the country – occupying one-fifth of Malawi’s area and stretching ~580 km (360 miles) in length. Its local name is Lake Nyasa, and it forms a beautiful blue ribbon along Malawi’s eastern border. As part of the Great Rift Valley’s chain of lakes, Lake Malawi is of great geological and ecological importance​. For birders, the lake’s presence means a chance to see a variety of aquatic and shoreline bird species, often in breathtaking settings.
    </p>

      Lake Malawi’s waters teem with life – not only does it harbor over 800 species of cichlid fishes found nowhere else (a fact which led to the lake being designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its evolutionary significance), but its shorelines also support scores of birds. General waterbirds such as kingfishers, cormorants and egrets are abundant along the lake​. In the reedy shallows you may find African Jacanas (the “lily-trotter” birds with huge feet) and various herons from the tiny Squacco Heron to the stately Goliath Heron. Ospreys migrate here from Europe and Asia to fish in the warm waters during the northern winter, joining the resident Fish Eagles which are seemingly on every prominent perch. Indeed, the African Fish Eagle could well be the emblem of Lake Malawi – their piercing call becomes a familiar soundtrack anywhere you go on the lakeshore. These eagles are “impressive creatures with a 2m (6.5 ft) wingspan” and are never far from the water’s edge​, often seen swooping to snatch a fish with their talons, creating a spray of water and awe for any onlooker.

      One of the joys of birding around Lake Malawi is the blend of land and water environments. You might walk through a grove of fig trees and spot a Livingstone’s Turaco with its red wing flashes, then step out onto a beach where White-winged Black Terns flutter over the surf. On rocky islands or along certain shores, you can find colonies of White-breasted Cormorants and African Darters, wings outstretched to dry in the sun. Bee-eaters are often present hawking insects – the flashy White-fronted Bee-eater or the blue-cheeked bee-eater might be seen near lake beaches catching dragonflies on the wing. At dusk, flocks of Collared Pratincoles and Water Thick-knees patrol the shorelines for insects and small crustaceans. From the tiny and colorful paradise flycatcher to the large African harrier-hawk, as well as the ubiquitous Fish Eagle, there is a great range of birds to be seen here​. In other words, Lake Malawi offers a microcosm of the country’s birdlife: small and large, aquatic and arboreal, common and uncommon – all in one place.

      Birding aside, the experience of Lake Malawi is something truly special for nature lovers. The lake is famously dubbed the “Calendar Lake” (rumored to be 365 miles long and 52 miles wide, though the exact figures differ slightly) – it’s huge enough that standing on the shore feels akin to being at the ocean, with waves lapping and the far side invisible beyond the horizon. The water is clear and warm, inviting you to take a dip or snorkel. Peering beneath the surface reveals those jewel-like cichlid fish that aquarists worldwide marvel at – electric blues, sunny yellows, stripes and spots – an underwater kaleidoscope unique to Malawi. Overhead, swifts and swallows wheel in the sky, sometimes joined by migratory European Bee-eaters in season, adding to the sense that this lake is a crossroads for life. The surrounding vistas are stunning: in the north, hills and mountains (like the Viphya highlands or Nyika’s slopes) can be seen in the distance; in the south, the lake is encircled by rolling plains and the dramatic backdrop of the Rift Valley escarpment.

      A visit to Lake Malawi National Park at Cape Maclear (towards the southern end of the lake) is often included in broader tours – this was Africa’s first freshwater national park and a UNESCO site, protecting both fish and birds. There one can climb rocky viewpoints for panoramic views of the lake at sunset, often hearing the calls of Rock Dassies and seeing Bohm’s Spinetail swifts darting around the cliffs. The sunset over Lake Malawi is legendary: as the sun dips, the sky ignites in shades of orange, pink, and purple, reflecting off the calm lake surface. It’s a daily show that leaves travelers and locals alike in quiet reverence. Come night, you understand why it’s also called the Lake of Stars – the lights of fishermen on the water mirror the constellations above, creating a double starlit spectacle.

      As you conclude your Malawi birding journey by the shores of Lake Malawi, you’ll likely feel a deep appreciation for this country’s natural richness and the gentle spirit of its people. In a relatively short span of time, you will have experienced savannas with elephants, misty mountains with rare birds, rustic villages, and tranquil lakeside vistas. The diversity of birds – from that tiny twinspot in Lilongwe to the flashy turacos of the forest, from the miombo specials to the lake’s fish eagles – is matched by the diversity of landscapes and the constant thread of Malawian hospitality throughout. A birding tour here is not just about ticking species; it’s about embracing the wonder of a country that has managed to pack an incredible array of wildlife and scenery within its borders, all while earning a reputation as one of the friendliest places on Earth. Malawi truly is “The Warm Heart of Africa,” and as you pack up your binoculars and camera, you carry with you warm memories of smiling guides, villagers’ waves, and of course, countless birds seen in this little slice of African paradise. Whether it was your first glimpse of a Lilian’s Lovebird in a baobab tree or watching Blue Swallows dance over alpine-like grasslands, Malawi’s birding treasures are bound to leave a lasting imprint – calling you back someday to experience it all over again. In Malawi, every birding tour is not just a trip, but an intimate journey through nature, beauty, and heart.
